Our understanding of the nature of this network as a whole remains limited, largely because of an array of technical challenges in the isolation and high-throughput sequencing of phosphorylated species. In the present work, we demonstrate that a combination of tandem phosphopeptide enrichment methods, high performance MS, and optimized database search/data filtering strategies is a powerful tool for surveying the phosphoproteome. Using our integrated analytical platform, we report the identification of 5,635 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 2,328 proteins from mouse liver. From this list of sites, we extracted both novel and known motifs for specific Ser/Thr kinases including a \"dipolar\" motif. We also found that C-terminal phosphorylation was more frequent than at any other location and that the distribution of potential kinases for these sites was unique. Finally, we identified double phosphorylation motifs that may be involved in ordered phosphorylation.',\n",

However, the cell origins and molecular mechanisms of iPS cell induction remain elusive. This report describes the generation of iPS cells from adult mouse hepatocytes and gastric epithelial cells. These iPS cell clones appear to be equivalent to embryonic stem cells in gene expression and are competent to generate germline chimeras. Genetic lineage tracings show that liver-derived iPS cells are derived from albumin-expressing cells. No common retroviral integration sites are found among multiple clones. These data suggest that iPS cells are generated by direct reprogramming of lineage-committed somatic cells and that retroviral integration into specific sites is not required.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The study of cancer genes in mouse models has traditionally relied on genetically-engineered strains made via transgenesis or gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Here we describe a new method of cancer model generation using the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system in vivo in wild-type mice. We used hydrodynamic injection to deliver a CRISPR plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the liver that directly target the tumour suppressor genes Pten (ref. 5) and p53 (also known as TP53 and Trp53) (ref. 6), alone and in combination. CRISPR-mediated Pten mutation led to elevated Akt phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, phenocopying the effects of deletion of the gene using Cre-LoxP technology. Simultaneous targeting of Pten and p53 induced liver tumours that mimicked those caused by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of Pten and p53. DNA sequencing of liver and tumour tissue revealed insertion or deletion mutations of the tumour suppressor genes, including bi-allelic mutations of both Pten and p53 in tumours. Furthermore, co-injection of Cas9 plasmids harbouring sgRNAs targeting the Î²-catenin gene and a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide donor carrying activating point mutations led to the generation of hepatocytes with nuclear localization of Î²-catenin. This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct mutation of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in the liver using the CRISPR/Cas system, which presents a new avenue for rapid development of liver cancer models and functional genomics.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A main oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) conveys circadian information to the peripheral clock systems for the regulation of fundamental physiological functions. Although polysynaptic autonomic neural pathways between the SCN and the liver were observed in rats, whether activation of the sympathetic nervous system entrains clock gene expression in the liver has yet to be understood. To assess sympathetic innervation from the SCN to liver tissue, we investigated whether injection of adrenaline/noradrenaline (epinephrine/norepinephrine) or sympathetic nerve stimulation could induce mPer gene expression in mouse liver. Acute administration of adrenaline or noradrenaline increased mPer1 but not mPer2 expression in the liver of mice in vivo and in hepatic slices in vitro. Electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerves or adrenaline injection caused an elevation of bioluminescence in the liver area of transgenic mice carrying mPer1 promoter-luciferase. Under a light-dark cycle, destruction of the SCN flattened the daily rhythms of not only mPer1, mPer2, and mBmal1 genes but also noradrenaline content in the liver. Daily injection of adrenaline, administered at a fixed time for 6 days, recovered oscillations of mPer2 and mBmal1 gene expression in the liver of mice with SCN lesion on day 7. Sympathetic nerve denervation by 6-hydroxydopamine flattened the daily rhythm of mPer1 and mPer2 gene expression. Thus, on the basis of the present results, activation of the sympathetic nerves through noradrenaline and/or adrenaline release was a factor controlling the peripheral clock.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the capability of revolutionizing research and therapy of liver diseases by providing a source of hepatocytes for autologous cell therapy and disease modelling. However, despite progress in advancing the differentiation of iPSCs into hepatocytes (iPSC-Heps) in vitro, cells that replicate the ability of human primary adult hepatocytes (aHeps) to proliferate extensively in vivo have not been reported. This deficiency has hampered efforts to recreate human liver diseases in mice, and has cast doubt on the potential of iPSC-Heps for liver cell therapy. The reason is that extensive post-transplant expansion is needed to establish and sustain a therapeutically effective liver cell mass in patients, a lesson learned from clinical trials of aHep transplantation. Here, as a solution to this problem, we report the generation of human fibroblast-derived hepatocytes that can repopulate mouse livers. Unlike current protocols for deriving hepatocytes from human fibroblasts, ours did not generate iPSCs but cut short reprogramming to pluripotency to generate an induced multipotent progenitor cell (iMPC) state from which endoderm progenitor cells and subsequently hepatocytes (iMPC-Heps) could be efficiently differentiated. For this purpose we identified small molecules that aided endoderm and hepatocyte differentiation without compromising proliferation. After transplantation into an immune-deficient mouse model of human liver failure, iMPC-Heps proliferated extensively and acquired levels of hepatocyte function similar to those of aHeps. Unfractionated iMPC-Heps did not form tumours, most probably because they never entered a pluripotent state. Our results establish the feasibility of significant liver repopulation of mice with human hepatocytes generated in vitro, which removes a long-standing roadblock on the path to autologous liver cell therapy.',\n",

Histone acetylation is inversely related to HDAC3 binding, and this rhythm is lost when HDAC3 is absent. Although amounts of HDAC3 are constant, its genomic recruitment in liver corresponds to the expression pattern of the circadian nuclear receptor Rev-erbÎ±. Rev-erbÎ± colocalizes with HDAC3 near genes regulating lipid metabolism, and deletion of HDAC3 or Rev-erbÎ± in mouse liver causes hepatic steatosis.

The ability to distinguish between promotion of background tumors versus a genotoxic mechanism of tumor initiation by chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of rodent carcinogenesis data. Activated oncogenes in chemically induced and spontaneously occurring mouse liver tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased incidence of mouse liver tumors. Data suggest that furan and furfural caused an increased incidence in mouse liver tumors at least in part by induction of novel weakly activating point mutations in ras genes even though both chemicals did not induce mutations in Salmonella assays. In addition to ras oncogenes, two activated raf genes and four non-ras transforming genes were detected. The B6C3F1 mouse liver may thus provide a sensitive assay system to detect various classes of proto-oncogenes that are susceptible to activation by carcinogenic insult. As illustrated with mouse liver tumors, analysis of activated oncogenes in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced rodent tumors will provide information at a molecular level to aid in the use of rodent carcinogenesis data for risk assessment.',\n",

During nutrient deprivation, cellular lipids stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets are hydrolysed into fatty acids for energy. A second cellular response to starvation is the induction of autophagy, which delivers intracellular proteins and organelles sequestered in double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) to lysosomes for degradation and use as an energy source. Lipolysis and autophagy share similarities in regulation and function but are not known to be interrelated. Here we show a previously unknown function for autophagy in regulating intracellular lipid stores (macrolipophagy). Lipid droplets and autophagic components associated during nutrient deprivation, and inhibition of autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver increased triglyceride storage in lipid droplets. This study identifies a critical function for autophagy in lipid metabolism that could have important implications for human diseases with lipid over-accumulation such as those that comprise the metabolic syndrome.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Forkhead Box (Fox) proteins are an extensive family of transcription factors that shares homology in the winged helix DNA-binding domain and whose members play essential roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation, longevity, and metabolic homeostasis. Liver regeneration studies with transgenic mice demonstrated that FoxM1B regulates the onset of hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis by stimulating expression of cell cycle genes. Here, we demonstrate that albumin-promoter-driven Cre recombinase-mediated hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Foxm1b Floxed (fl) targeted allele resulted in significant reduction in hepatocyte DNA replication and inhibition of mitosis after partial hepatectomy. Reduced DNA replication in regenerating Foxm1b<SUP>-/-</SUP> hepatocytes was associated with sustained increase in nuclear staining of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21<SUP>Cip1</SUP> (p21) protein between 24 and 40 h after partial hepatectomy. Furthermore, increased nuclear p21 levels and reduced expression of Cdc25A phosphatase coincided with decreases in Cdk2 activation and hepatocyte progression into S-phase. Moreover, the significant reduction in hepatocyte mitosis was associated with diminished mRNA levels and nuclear expression of Cdc25B phosphatase and delayed accumulation of cyclin B1 protein, which is required for Cdk1 activation and entry into mitosis. Cotransfection studies demonstrate that FoxM1B protein directly activated transcription of the Cdc25B promoter region. Our present study shows that the mammalian Foxm1b transcription factor regulates expression of cell cycle proteins essential for hepatocyte entry into DNA replication and mitosis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'First-generation recombinant adenoviruses that lack E1 sequences have shown tremendous promise in animal and human models of gene therapy. Important limitations of these vectors are that recombinant gene expression is transient and inflammation occurs at the site of gene transfer. Our hypothesis for generating vectors with increased persistence is that present recombinant adenoviruses express viral proteins that stimulate cellular immune responses leading to destruction of the infected cells and repopulation of the organ with non-transgene-containing cells. This model predicts that further crippling of the virus will improve persistence and diminish pathology. We describe in this report second-generation recombinant adenoviruses harboring a beta-galactosidase-expressing transgene in which a temperature-sensitive mutation has been introduced into the E2A gene of an E1-deleted recombinant. At nonpermissive temperature, this virus fails to express late gene products, even when E1 is expressed in trans. The biology of this recombinant was studied in vivo in the context of mouse liver, a setting that is permissive for adenovirus type 5 replication. Animals that received the second-generation virus expressed the transgene for at least 70 days, whereas expression of the first-generation virus was no longer than 14 days. In addition, the inflammatory response, as measured by infiltration of CD8+ T cells, was blunted and delayed in livers infected with second-generation virus. These studies illustrate that modifications that disrupt structural protein expression in recombinant adenoviruses may be useful in enhancing their utility for gene therapy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Reconstruction of heterogeneity through single cell transcriptional profiling has greatly advanced our understanding of the spatial liver transcriptome in recent years. However, global transcriptional differences across lobular units remain elusive in physical space. Here, we apply Spatial Transcriptomics to perform transcriptomic analysis across sectioned liver tissue. We confirm that the heterogeneity in this complex tissue is predominantly determined by lobular zonation. By introducing novel computational approaches, we enable transcriptional gradient measurements between tissue structures, including several lobules in a variety of orientations. Further, our data suggests the presence of previously transcriptionally uncharacterized structures within liver tissue, contributing to the overall spatial heterogeneity of the organ. This study demonstrates how comprehensive spatial transcriptomic technologies can be used to delineate extensive spatial gene expression patterns in the liver, indicating its future impact for studies of liver function, development and regeneration as well as its potential in pre-clinical and clinical pathology.',\n",

We have interrogated the transcriptional architecture of the circadian transcriptional regulatory loop on a genome scale in mouse liver and find a stereotyped, time-dependent pattern of transcription factor binding, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment, RNA expression, and chromatin states. We find that the circadian transcriptional cycle of the clock consists of three distinct phases: a poised state, a coordinated de novo transcriptional activation state, and a repressed state. Only 22% of messenger RNA (mRNA) cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms underlie the mammalian circadian clock. We also find that circadian modulation of RNAPII recruitment and chromatin remodeling occurs on a genome-wide scale far greater than that seen previously by gene expression profiling.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) &amp; BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.',\n",

Here we show that a third, NADPH-independent pathway can bypass the need for TrxR1 and GR in mammalian liver. Most mice genetically engineered to lack both TrxR1 and GR in all hepatocytes (âTR/GR-null liversâ) remain long-term viable. TR/GR-null livers cannot reduce oxidized glutathione disulfide using NADPH but still require continuous glutathione synthesis. Inhibition of cystathionine Î³-lyase causes rapid necrosis of TR/GR-null livers, indicating that methionine-fueled trans-sulfuration supplies the necessary cysteine precursor for glutathione synthesis via an NADPH-independent pathway. We further show that dietary methionine provides the cytosolic disulfide-reducing power and all sulfur amino acids in TR/GR-null livers. Although NADPH is generally considered an essential reducing currency, these results indicate that hepatocytes can adequately sustain cytosolic redox homeostasis pathways using either NADPH or methionine.',\n",

In this study, identification of the repertoire of signaling proteins was performed using a proteomics approach involving cellular responses of liver tissue to ionizing radiation. Approximately 800 protein spots were detected. Among them, at least 28 proteins showed significant quantitative alterations after radiation. The significantly altered proteins were categorized as those related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, metabolic pathway proteins, and Gâtype proteins. Particularly, the expression levels of proteins related to ROS metabolism, including cytochrome c, glutathione Sâtransferase Pi, NADH dehydrogenase, and peroxiredoxin VI, were increased after radiation. It is suggested that although radiation initiates cytotoxic effects, it can also induce a radioprotective antioxidant system.',\n",

Acta 752, 259-264]. We analyzed the changes in stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA to further define the molecular mechanism for the induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase by peroxisome proliferators. SCD1 mRNA was analyzed from the livers of BALB/c mice that had been fed diets supplemented with clofibrate or gemfibrozil. Clofibrate was found to induce liver SCD1 mRNA levels 3-fold within 6 hr to a maximum of 22-fold in 30 hr. Gemfibrozil administration resulted in a similar induction pattern. This induction is primarily due to an increase in transcription of the SCD1 gene, as shown by nuclear run-on transcription assays and DNA deletion analysis of transfected SCD1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes. The cis-linked response element for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) was localized to an AGGTCA consensus sequence between base pairs -664 to -642 of the SCD1 promoter. Clofibrate-mediated induction of SCD1 mRNA was shown to be independent of polyunsaturated fatty acids, with peroxisome proliferators and arachidonic acid having opposite effects on SCD1 mRNA levels. Additionally, the activation of SCD1 mRNA by clofibrate was inhibited 77% by cycloheximide administration. Levels of liver beta-actin and albumin mRNAs were unchanged by these dietary manipulations. Our data show that hepatic SCD1 gene expression is regulated by PPARs and suggest that peroxisome proliferators and poly-unsaturated fatty acids act through distinct mechanisms.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excess absorption of dietary iron and progressive iron deposition in several tissues, particularly liver. Liver disease resulting from iron toxicity is the major cause of death in HH. Hepatic iron loading in HH is progressive despite down-regulation of the classical transferrin receptor (TfR). Recently a human cDNA highly homologous to TfR was identified and reported to encode a protein (TfR2) that binds holotransferrin and mediates uptake of transferrin-bound iron. We independently identified a full-length murine EST encoding the mouse orthologue of the human TfR2. Although homologous to murine TfR in the coding region, the TfR2 transcript does not contain the iron-responsive elements found in the 3' untranslated sequence of TfR mRNA. To determine the potential role for TfR2 in iron uptake by liver, we investigated TfR and TfR2 expression in normal mice and murine models of dietary iron overload (2% carbonyl iron), dietary iron deficiency (gastric parietal cell ablation), and HH (HFE -/-). Northern blot analyses demonstrated distinct tissue-specific patterns of expression for TfR and TfR2, with TfR2 expressed highly only in liver where TfR expression is low. In situ hybridization demonstrated abundant TfR2 expression in hepatocytes. In contrast to TfR, TfR2 expression in liver was not increased in iron deficiency. Furthermore, hepatic expression of TfR2 was not down-regulated with dietary iron loading or in the HFE -/- model of HH. From these observations, we propose that TfR2 allows continued uptake of Tf-bound iron by hepatocytes even after TfR has been down-regulated by iron overload, and this uptake contributes to the susceptibility of liver to iron loading in HH.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers of chromosome organization, including segregation into megabase-sized active and inactive compartments, and partitioning into sub-megabase domains (TADs). It remains unclear, however, how these layers of organization form, interact with one another and influence genome function. Here we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl in mouse liver leads to a marked reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated Hi-C peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. By contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the three-dimensional organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which helps to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.',\n",

The extent of circadian gene regulation in peripheral tissues is unclear, and to what degree circadian regulation in different tissues involves common or specialized pathways is unknown. Here we report a comparative analysis of circadian gene expression in vivo in mouse liver and heart using oligonucleotide arrays representing 12,488 genes. We find that peripheral circadian gene regulation is extensive (&gt;=8-10% of the genes expressed in each tissue), that the distributions of circadian phases in the two tissues are markedly different, and that very few genes show circadian regulation in both tissues. This specificity of circadian regulation cannot be accounted for by tissue-specific gene expression. Despite this divergence, the clock-regulated genes in liver and heart participate in overlapping, extremely diverse processes. A core set of 37 genes with similar circadian regulation in both tissues includes candidates for new clock genes and output genes, and it contains genes responsive to circulating factors with circadian or diurnal rhythms.',\n",

The enrichment at specific carbons of glucose, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, acetate, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate has been measured. The specific labeling of glutamate in the presence of labeled alanine and labeled or unlabeled ethanol shows that, under these conditions, alanine enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle almost exclusively through pyruvate carboxylation, whereas ethanol is the exclusive source of acetyl-CoA. In the absence of ethanol, the alanine label flows through both paths. By comparing the scrambling of 13C between C3 and C2 of glutamate it is possible to estimate the mitochondrial fumarase activity; the C6-to-C5 ratios in glucose give the additional scrambling by cytosolic fumarase activity. In addition, the C6-to-C1 and C5-to-C2 ratios in glucose show that there is about 15% flux through the pentose cycle. Finally, the C4-to-C2 ratios in glutamine and glutamate are unequal at any time (the glutamine labels reflect the label distribution in glutamate measured 1 hr earlier), providing a method for studying flow through glutamine synthetase in situ.',\n",

These results indicate that all the members of this mRNA group are not under common developmental regulation.

       "    'abstract': 'It has been proposed that a ring-opened form may be responsible for the toxicity of benzene. The present studies demonstrate that incubation of [14C]benzene with liver microsomes (obtained from male CD-1 mice treated with benzene) in the presence of NADPH results in the formation of a ring-opened product. Evidence for the identity of this product was obtained by derivatizing with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), which resulted in the formation of an adduct with a 490-nm absorbance maximum. This maximum is identical to that observed after authentic trans,trans-muconaldehyde has reacted with TBA. Separation of muconaldehyde, both with and without trapping with TBA, from other benzene metabolites in the incubation mixture was accomplished by HPLC. The radioactivity profile of fractions collected during HPLC analysis contained peaks that eluted with muconaldehyde and the muconaldehyde-TBA adduct. The structure of the ring-opened product was confirmed by mass spectrometry, studies in which the HPLC peak from the microsomal incubation mixture that eluted at the retention time of authentic muconaldehyde was collected and derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. The high-resolution mass spectrum of this sample contained an ion with an m/z of 291.0729, corresponding to muconaldehyde mono-dinitrophenylhydrazone. These results indicate that benzene is metabolized in vitro to a ring-opened product identified as muconaldehyde.',\n",

Identifying and targeting these rare cancer cells, however, remains challenging with respect to therapeutic benefit. Here, we report the enrichment of LGR5 expressing cells, a well-recognized stem cell marker, in mouse liver tumors, and the upregulation of LGR5 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Isolated LGR5 expressing cells from mouse liver tumors are superior in initiating organoids and forming tumors upon engraftment, featuring candidate TICs. These cells are resistant to conventional treatment including sorafenib and 5-FU. Importantly, LGR5 lineage ablation significantly inhibits organoid initiation and tumor growth. The combination of LGR5 ablation with 5-FU, but not sorafenib, further augments the therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Thus, we have identified the LGR5<SUP>+</SUP> compartment as an important TIC population, representing a viable therapeutic target for combating liver cancer.',\n",

Here, we demonstrate that the fibroblast growth factor-21 gene (Fgf21) is subject to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î±-dependent DNA demethylation in the liver during the postnatal period. Reductions in Fgf21 methylation can be enhanced via pharmacologic activation of PPARÎ± during the suckling period. We also reveal that the DNA methylation status of Fgf21, once established in early life, is relatively stable and persists into adulthood. Reduced DNA methylation is associated with enhanced induction of hepatic FGF21 expression after PPARÎ± activation, which may partly explain the attenuation of diet-induced obesity in adulthood. We propose that Fgf21 methylation represents a form of epigenetic memory that persists into adulthood, and it may have a role in the developmental programming of obesity.',\n",

The cDNA clones were identified by screening 1400 cDNA clones made from 9--10S mouse liver poly(A)+ mRNA. The procedure for screening the cDNA clones involved binding pooled plasmid DNA to nitrocellulose filters and testing the ability of each filter to select beta 2-microglobulin mRNA. The filter-selected mRNAs were assayed for their ability to direct the synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin in translation reactions in vitro. The isolated clones were shown by nucleotide sequence analysis to encode beta 2-microglobulin. The positive-selection--hybridization assay has been modified to facilitate the screening of large numbers of cDNA clones, and the modified assay should allow the isolation of cDNAs corresponding to any mRNA whose in vitro translation products can be immunoprecipitated. These modifications are of particular value in the isolation of cDNA clones corresponding to rare species of mRNA.',\n",

Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.',\n",

The magnetic field in the space of 60 mm<SUP>3</SUP> is about 300 mT which generate by two permanent magnets. A plane transducer with 2.25 MHz center frequency is utilized to generate acoustic waves inside the object. The signal is detected by two similar 1 mm copper foil electrodes. An amplifier is designed to receive the MAET signal, and the gain of the amplifier is adjusted to be 54 dB. The phantom used in this paper is a mouse liver surrounded by a gel phantom with the conductivity of 0.7 S m<SUP>-1</SUP>. The gel phantom with the conductivity of 0.7 S m<SUP>-1</SUP> is used to simulate the liver tumor, and the normal mouse liver is filled in the phantom. A series of the MAET signals are detected by the electrodes when the transducer is moved on a pre-set line route, then a B-scan image is realized. The experimental system can provide more information about the tumor and the results show that the MAET is sensitive enough for the potential clinical application of tumor in animal or human.',\n",

Glucocorticoids and glucagon have strong gluconeogenic actions on the liver. In contrast, insulin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis. Two components known to have important physiological roles in this process are the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 (also known as FKHR) and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-Î³ co-activator 1 (PGC-1Î± also known as PPARGC1), a transcriptional co-activator; whether and how these factors collaborate has not been clear. Using wild-type and mutant alleles of FOXO1, here we show that PGC-1Î± binds and co-activates FOXO1 in a manner inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, FOXO1 function is required for the robust activation of gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatic cells and in mouse liver by PGC-1Î±. Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis stimulated by PGC-1Î± but co-expression of a mutant allele of FOXO1 insensitive to insulin completely reverses this suppression in hepatocytes or transgenic mice. We conclude that FOXO1 and PGC-1Î± interact in the execution of a programme of powerful, insulin-regulated gluconeogenesis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) is a highly conserved nuclear receptor that plays an important role in the manifestation of toxicity induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. As a xenobiotic sensor, Ahr is involved in chemical biotransformation through activation of drug metabolizing enzymes. The activated Ahr cooperates with coactivator complexes to induce epigenetic modifications at target genes. Thus, it is conceivable that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent Ahr ligand, may elicit robust epigenetic changes in vivo at the Ahr target gene cytochrome P450 1a1 (Cyp1a1). A single dose of TCDD administered to adult mice induced Ahr-dependent CpG hypomethylation, changes in histone modifications, and thymine DNA glycosylase (Tdg) recruitment at the Cyp1a1 promoter in the liver within 24\\u2009hrs. These epigenetic changes persisted until 40 days post-TCDD treatment and there was Cyp1a1 mRNA hyperinduction upon repeat administration of TCDD at this time-point. Our demethylation assay using siRNA knockdown and an in vitro methylated plasmid showed that Ahr, Tdg, and the ten-eleven translocation methyldioxygenases Tet2 and Tet3 are required for the TCDD-induced DNA demethylation. These results provide novel evidence of Ahr-driven active DNA demethylation and epigenetic memory. The epigenetic alterations influence response to subsequent chemical exposure and imply an adaptive mechanism to xenobiotic stress.',\n",

Here we show through a series of studies in human cohorts and human-derived hepatocytes that a common noncoding polymorphism at the 1p13 locus, rs12740374, creates a C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) transcription factor binding site and alters the hepatic expression of the SORT1 gene. With small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and viral overexpression in mouse liver, we demonstrate that Sort1 alters plasma LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle levels by modulating hepatic VLDL secretion. Thus, we provide functional evidence for a novel regulatory pathway for lipoprotein metabolism and suggest that modulation of this pathway may alter risk for MI in humans. We also demonstrate that common noncoding DNA variants identified by GWASs can directly contribute to clinical phenotypes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hepatic lipid synthesis is known to be regulated by food consumption. In rodents fasting decreases the synthesis of cholesterol as well as fatty acids. Refeeding a high carbohydrate/low fat diet enhances fatty acid synthesis by 5- to 20-fold above the fed state, whereas cholesterol synthesis returns only to the prefasted level. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Here, we show that fasting markedly reduces the amounts of SREBP-1 and -2 in mouse liver nuclei, with corresponding decreases in the mRNAs for SREBP-activated target genes. Refeeding a high carbohydrate/low fat diet resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase of nuclear SREBP-1 above nonfasted levels, whereas nuclear SREBP-2 protein returned only to the nonfasted level. The hepatic mRNAs for fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes increased 5- to 10-fold above nonfasted levels, a pattern that paralleled the changes in nuclear SREBP-1. The hepatic mRNAs for enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis returned to the nonfasted level, closely following the pattern of nuclear SREBP-2 regulation. Transgenic mice that overproduce nuclear SREBP-1c failed to show the normal decrease in hepatic mRNA levels for cholesterol and fatty acid synthetic enzymes upon fasting. We conclude that SREBPs are regulated by food consumption in the mouse liver and that the decline in nuclear SREBP-1c upon fasting may explain in part the decrease in mRNAs encoding enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.',\n",

The same applies to mitochondrial (mt) pools of cultured cells. Song et al. [Song S, Pursell ZF, Copeland WC, Longley MJ, Kunkel TA, Mathews CK (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:4990-4995] reported that mt pools of rat tissues instead are highly asymmetric, with the dGTP pool in some cases being several-hundred-fold larger than the dTTP pool, and suggested that the asymmetry contributes to increased mutagenesis during mt DNA replication. We have now investigated this discrepancy and determined the size of each dNTP pool in mouse liver mitochondria. We found large variations in pool sizes that closely followed variations in the ATP pool and depended on the length of time spent in the preparation of mitochondria. The proportion between dNTPs was in all cases without major asymmetries and similar to those found earlier in cultured resting cells. We also investigated the import and export of thymidine phosphates in mouse liver mitochondria and provide evidence for a rapid, highly selective, and saturable import of dTMP, not depending on a functional respiratory chain. At nM external dTMP the nucleotide is concentrated 100-fold inside the mt matrix. Export of thymidine phosphates was much slower and possibly occurred at the level of dTDP.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Methylation of CpG sites in the genome, which is generally conserved during cell replication, is considered to play important roles in cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. However, investigations on changes in methylation status have been limited to known genes. To make a genome-wide search for differentially methylated genes, we developed a methylation-sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) method. The representation of the genome was prepared using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII, and the mixture ratio of tester and driver DNAs was optimized to detect differences in methylation status of a single copy per diploid mammalian genome. By performing comparative MS-RDA of one hepatocellular carcinoma and of background liver tissue of one mouse treated with a food carcinogen (2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline), we were able to identify (i) extensive hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear element repetitive sequences in a number of hepatocellular carcinomas, (ii) reduction of the gene dosage of their mitochondrial DNA, and (iii) a hypermethylated DNA fragment of unknown origin. Furthermore, by adding the clones obtained in the first MS-RDA to the driver DNA [MS-RDA with elimination of excessive clones (MS-RDA-WEEC)], nine DNA fragments that could not be detected at the first MS-RDA were isolated as differentially methylated DNA fragments. MS-RDA, combined with MS-RDA-WEEC, is thus a promising approach to identify DNA fragments differentially methylated in two DNA sources.',\n",

As a result, TCS has significantly affected the environment and has been frequently detected in human body fluids. Through a long-term feeding study, we found that TCS enhances hepatocyte proliferation, fibrogenesis, and oxidative stress, which, we believe, can be the driving force for developing advanced liver disease in mice. Indeed, TCS strongly enhances hepatocarcinogenesis after diethylnitrosamine initiation, accelerating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Although animal studies require higher chemical concentrations than predicted for human exposure, this study demonstrates that TCS acts as a HCC tumor promoter and that the mechanism of TCS-induced mouse liver pathology may be relevant to humans.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Bile acids (BAs) play two vital roles in living organisms, as they are involved in (1) the secretion of cholesterol from liver, and (2) the lipid digestion/absorption in the intestine. Abnormal bile acid synthesis or secretion can lead to severe liver disorders. Even though there is extensive literature on the mass spectrometric determination of BAs in biofluids and tissue homogenates, there are no reports on the spatial distribution in the biliary network of the liver. Here, we demonstrate the application of high mass resolution/mass accuracy matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) to MS imaging (MSI) of BAs at high spatial resolutions (pixel size, 25 Î¼m). The results show chemical heterogeneity of the mouse liver sections with a number of branching biliary and blood ducts. In addition to ion signals from deprotonation of the BA molecules, MALDI-MSI generated several further intense signals at larger m/z for the BAs. These signals were spatially co-localized with the deprotonated molecules and easily misinterpreted as additional products of BA biotransformations. In-depth analysis of accurate mass shifts and additional electrospray ionization and MALDI-FTICR experiments, however, confirmed them as proton-bound dimers. Interestingly, dimers of bile acids, but also unusual mixed dimers of different taurine-conjugated bile acids and free taurine, were identified. Since formation of these complexes will negatively influence signal intensities of the desired [M - H]<SUP>-</SUP> ions and significantly complicate mass spectral interpretations, two simple broadband techniques were proposed for non-selective dissociation of dimers that lead to increased signals for the deprotonated BAs. <P />[Figure not available: see fulltext.]',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mitochondria from diverse organisms are capable of transporting large amounts of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> via a ruthenium-red-sensitive, membrane-potential-dependent mechanism called the uniporter. Although the uniporter's biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), an EF-hand-containing protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter. Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide RNA co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to MICU1. All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, CCDC109A, that we now call `mitochondrial calcium uniporter' (MCU). MCU forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with MICU1, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing MCU in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. MCU has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an S259A point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> uniporter.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In the previous work, we incubated THP1 cells and macrophages in vitro with unsubstituted ferrofluid (FF) and placed them in an alternating magnetic field. This resulted in the destruction of the cells (magnetocytolysis). Cell-specific magnetocytolysis in vitro was achieved in MCF7 human breast cancer cells incubated with tamoxifen-bound FF and treated in an alternating magnetic field. In this work, in a search of a model for magnetocytolysis in vivo, we injected mice intravenously with hepatospecific magnetic nanoparticles (HS-USPIO) and subjected the mice to magnetocytolysis in an alternating magnetic field (1 h at 200 A/m). This treatment resulted in a prolongation of blood coagulation time due to depletion of protein coagulation factors that are synthesized exclusively in the liver. The attendant derangement of liver protein synthesis was characterized in cell-free preparations by an inhibition of the endogenously coded protein synthesis coupled with an enhancement of phenylalanine polymerization directed by polyuridylic acid (Poly U). This indication of polyribosome dispersion was confirmed by electron microscopy. Magnetocytolysis did not cause liver necrosis and was neither accompanied by any increase in body or liver temperature, nor damage to any other tissue. The effects of magnetocytolysis were proportional to the amount of injected HS-USPIO, field strength and its application time. Magnetocytolysis did not occur when non-magnetic PolyGalactoseGold particles were substituted for HS-USPIO. PolyGalactoseGold particles were employed to measure asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) activity in liver using neutron activation analysis. Injection of PolyGalactoseGold particles to mice, pre-treated by HS-USPIO driven magnetocytolysis, revealed a transient diminution of hepatic ASGP-R. Liver damage from magnetocytolysis was followed by liver regeneration, manifested by the appearance of thymidylate kinase activity, diminution of ASGP-R and return to normal blood coagulation time.',\n",

Livers of mice held under constant darkness exhibit circadian rhythm in abundance in up to 15% of expressed transcripts. Therefore, oscillations in hepatic transcripts could be driven by rhythmic food intake or sustained by the hepatic circadian oscillator, or a combination of both. To address this question, we used distinct feeding and fasting paradigms on wild-type (WT) and circadian clock-deficient mice. We monitored temporal patterns of feeding and hepatic transcription. Both food availability and the temporal pattern of feeding determined the repertoire, phase, and amplitude of the circadian transcriptome in WT liver. In the absence of feeding, only a small subset of transcripts continued to express circadian patterns. Conversely, temporally restricted feeding restored rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes in oscillator-deficient mouse liver. Our findings show that both temporal pattern of food intake and the circadian clock drive rhythmic transcription, thereby highlighting temporal regulation of hepatic transcription as an emergent property of the circadian system.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'DNA methylation plays a key role in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process that achieves dosage compensation for X-encoded gene products between mammalian female and male cells. However, differential sex chromosome dosage complicates genome-wide epigenomic assessments, and the X chromosome is frequently excluded from female-to-male comparative analyses. Using the X chromosome in the sexually dimorphic mouse liver as a model, we provide a general framework for comparing base-resolution DNA methylation patterns across samples that have different chromosome numbers and ask at a systematic level if predictions by historical analyses of X-linked DNA methylation hold true at a base-resolution chromosome-wide level. We demonstrate that sex-specific methylation patterns on the X chromosome largely reflect the effects of XCI. While our observations concur with longstanding observations of XCI at promoter-proximal CpG islands, we provide evidence that sex-specific DNA methylation differences are not limited to CpG island boundaries. Moreover, these data support a model in which maintenance of CpG islands in the inactive state does not require complete regional methylation.

Similar rates of hepatic transduction were obtained by direct injection of the liver or by systemic delivery via tail vein injection. Hepatocytes were much more efficiently transduced than other cells after systemic delivery, and up to 3% of all hepatocytes could be transduced after one vector injection. The presence of wild-type AAV, which contaminates many AAV vector preparations, was required to observe a full response to Î³-irradiation. Injection of mice with AAV vectors encoding human clotting factor IX after Î³-irradiation resulted in synthesis of low levels of human clotting factor IX for the 5-month period of observation.

Here we show that the sterol-responsive nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway through transcriptional induction of Idol (inducible degrader of the LDLR), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduces, whereas LXR knockout increases, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a tissue-selective manner. Idol knockdown in hepatocytes increases LDLR protein levels and promotes LDL uptake. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes LDLR degradation and elevates plasma LDL levels. The LXR-Idol-LDLR axis defines a complementary pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol regulation of cholesterol uptake.',\n",

It is thought that the mtPTP is a protein complex formed by the voltage-dependent anion channel, members of the pro- and anti-apoptotic BAX-BCL2 protein family, cyclophilin D, and the adenine nucleotide (ADP/ATP) translocators (ANTs). The latter exchange mitochondrial ATP for cytosolic ADP and have been implicated in cell death. To investigate the role of the ANTs in the mtPTP, we genetically inactivated the two isoforms of ANT in mouse liver and analysed mtPTP activation in isolated mitochondria and the induction of cell death in hepatocytes. Mitochondria lacking ANT could still be induced to undergo permeability transition, resulting in release of cytochrome c. However, more Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> than usual was required to activate the mtPTP, and the pore could no longer be regulated by ANT ligands. Moreover, hepatocytes without ANT remained competent to respond to various initiators of cell death.

Clock and Bmal1 are essential transcription factors that drive the expression of three period genes (Per1-3) and two cryptochrome genes (Cry1 and Cry2). The Cry proteins feedback to inhibit Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription by a mechanism that does not alter Clock/Bmal1 binding to DNA. Here we show that transcriptional regulation of the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3 histone acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the Per1, Per2 and Cry1 genes exhibit circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation and RNA polymerase II binding that are synchronous with the corresponding steady-state messenger RNA rhythms. The histone acetyltransferase p300 precipitates together with Clock in vivo in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibit a p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. The delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm, relative to the Per rhythms, is due to the coordinated activities of Rev-ErbÎ± and Clock/Bmal1, and defines a new mechanism for circadian phase control.',\n",

Increased serum FGF23 is a well-established predictor of mortality in renal disease, but recent findings linking increased levels to hepatic and cardiac diseases have suggested that other organs are sources of FGF23 or targets of its effects. The potential ability of the liver to produce FGF23 in response to hepatocellular injury was therefore examined. Very low levels of Fgf23 mRNA and FGF23 protein were detected in normal mouse liver, but the amounts increased markedly during acute liver injury from the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride. Serum levels of intact FGF23 were elevated during liver injury from carbon tetrachloride. Chronic liver injury induced by a high fat diet or elevated bile acids also increased hepatic FGF23 levels. Stimulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-driven inflammation by gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) underlies many forms of liver injury, and LPS induced Fgf23 in the liver as well as in other organs. The LPS-inducible cytokines IL-1Î² and TNF increased hepatic Fgf23 expression as did a TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK3. Analysis of Fgf23 expression and FGF23 secretion in different hepatic cell types involved in liver injury identified the resident liver macrophage or Kupffer cell as a source of hepatic FGF23. LPS and cytokines selectively induced the hormone in these cells but not in hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells. FGF23 failed to exert any autocrine effect on the inflammatory state of Kupffer cells but did trigger proinflammatory activation of hepatocytes. During liver injury inflammatory factors induce Kupffer cell production of FGF23 that may have a paracrine proinflammatory effect on hepatocytes. Liver-produced FGF23 may have systemic hormonal effects as well that influence diseases in in other organs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcriptional regulators of cellular and systemic cholesterol homeostasis. Under conditions of excess cholesterol, LXR activation induces the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux, facilitates cholesterol esterification by promoting fatty acid synthesis, and inhibits cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor. The fact that sterol content is maintained in a narrow range in most cell types and in the organism as a whole suggests that extensive crosstalk between regulatory pathways must exist. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate LXRs with other lipid metabolic pathways are incompletely understood. Here we show that ligand activation of LXRs in mouse liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long non-coding RNA LeXis as a mediator of this effect. Hepatic LeXis expression is robustly induced in response to a Western diet (high in fat and cholesterol) or to pharmacological LXR activation. Raising or lowering LeXis levels in the liver affects the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and alters the cholesterol levels in the liver and plasma. LeXis interacts with and affects the DNA interactions of RALY, a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein that acts as a transcriptional cofactor for cholesterol biosynthetic genes in the mouse liver. These findings outline a regulatory role for a non-coding RNA in lipid metabolism and advance our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate sterol homeostasis.',\n",

We use a physiologically-based model to calculate blood-flow rates in a network of mouse liver sinusoids and simulate transport, uptake and biotransformation of xenobiotics within the in silico lobule. Using our base model, we then explore the effects of variations of compound-specific (diffusion, transport and metabolism) and compound-independent (temporal alteration of blood flow pattern) parameters, and examine their influence on the distribution of xenobiotics and metabolites. Our simulations show that the transport mechanism (diffusive and transporter-mediated) of xenobiotics and blood flow both impact the regional distribution of xenobiotics in a mouse hepatic lobule. Furthermore, differential expression of metabolic enzymes along each sinusoid's portal to central axis, together with differential cellular availability of xenobiotics, induce non-uniform production of metabolites. Thus, the heterogeneity of the biochemical and biophysical properties of xenobiotics, along with the complexity of blood flow, result in different exposures to xenobiotics for hepatocytes at different lobular locations. <P />We acknowledge support from National Institute of Health GM 077138 and GM 111243.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Poly(A) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function. Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other `housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.\",\n",

Although posttranslational modification of clock proteins is likely to finely control their circadian functions, only limited information is available to date. Here, we show that BMAL1, an essential transcription factor component of the clock mechanism, is SUMOylated on a highly conserved lysine residue (Lys<SUP>259</SUP>) in vivo. BMAL1 shows a circadian pattern of SUMOylation that parallels its activation in the mouse liver. SUMOylation of BMAL1 requires and is induced by CLOCK, the heterodimerization partner of BMAL1. Ectopic expression of a SUMO-deficient BMAL1 demonstrates that SUMOylation plays an important role in BMAL1 circadian expression and clock rhythmicity.

       "    'abstract': \"The main ethanol-active alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) in mouse liver (ADH-AA) is similar in catalytic and molecular properties to horse liver ADH-EE and to the human class I ADHs. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding the entire mouse liver enzyme plus flanking regions. A mixture of 16 different oligonucleotides, each 14 bases long, was used to screen a liver cDNA library made from a DBA/2J mouse. A strongly hybridizing clone was found and identified as an ADH-encoding cDNA by partial DNA sequencing. This clone was used as a probe to identify others. Two overlapping cDNA clones together contained the entire protein-encoding region plus 100 nucleotides of the 5' noncoding region and 133 nucleotides of the 3' noncoding region culminating in a short poly(dA) tail. The amino acid sequence of the mouse liver enzyme deduced from this cDNA closely resembles that of horse liver ADH-E: 316 of 374 residues are identical, and 29 of the differences are conservative substitutions. The 5' region of this cDNA is interesting: the AUG that initiates the ADH polypeptide is preceded by an AUG that would encode the first amino acid of a tripeptide. Presumably termination of this tripeptide is followed by reinitiation at the AUG immediately preceding the sequence of the mature ADH polypeptide.\",\n",

The present work has been planned to study the histopathological and immunohistochemical expression of P53 and CD68 in mouse liver tissues experimentally infected with Schistosoma mansoni, in addition to the ameliorating role of silymarin. A total of 50 adult male mice were divided into 5 groups (10 animals each). Groups 1 and 2 were the control and silymarin groups, respectively, while group 3 was the infected group in which the mice were infected with S. mansoni live cercariae for 6 weeks. Groups 4 and 5 were the cotreated and posttreated groups, respectively, in which mice were infected with cercariae of S. mansoni and treated with silymarin during and after Schistosoma infection, respectively. The major histopathological lesions were variable numbers of perioval granulomas, diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly eosinophils and small mononuclear cells, and fibrosis of portal areas and interlobular septa. Treatment with silymarin led to a significant reduction in granuloma area in all treated infected mice compared with nontreated infected mice. Immunohistochemical observations of the liver tissues showed a significant increase in the apoptotic proteins P53 and CD68 after the infection with the cercariae of Schistosoma, compared with the control group. The expression of the cytoplasmic P53 and CD68 was very low in the control liver sections. A significant decrease in the expression of the cytoplasmic P53 and CD68 was observed after silymarin treatment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Regulation of circadian physiology relies on the interplay of interconnected transcriptional-translational feedback loops. The CLOCK-BMAL1 complex activates clock-controlled genes, including cryptochromes (Crys), the products of which act as repressors by interacting directly with CLOCK-BMAL1. We have demonstrated that CLOCK possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and that this enzymatic function contributes to chromatin-remodelling events implicated in circadian control of gene expression. Here we show that CLOCK also acetylates a non-histone substrate: its own partner, BMAL1, is specifically acetylated on a unique, highly conserved Lys537 residue. BMAL1 undergoes rhythmic acetylation in mouse liver, with a timing that parallels the downregulation of circadian transcription of clock-controlled genes. BMAL1 acetylation facilitates recruitment of CRY1 to CLOCK-BMAL1, thereby promoting transcriptional repression. Importantly, ectopic expression of a K537R-mutated BMAL1 is not able to rescue circadian rhythmicity in a cellular model of peripheral clock. These findings reveal that the enzymatic interplay between two clock core components is crucial for the circadian machinery.',\n",

Here, we identify targets of SREBP-1 in mammalian liver using chromatin immunoprecipitation-high-throughput DNA sequencing. Antisera to SREBP-1 were used with liver chromatin from mice fed a high-carbohydrate diet after a fast, which leads to superinduction of hepatic SREBP-1c expression. SREBP-1-DNA complexes were subjected to massive parallel DNA sequencing using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II, resulting in 5.7 million sequence reads. Mapping these reads to the mouse reference genome identified 426 peaks of SREBP-1 binding vs. a control antibody. These binding peaks show a striking enrichment in proximal promoter regions, with 52% located within 1 kb upstream of a transcription start site. A previously undescribed sequence motif (5\\'-ACTACANNTCCC-3\\') was present in 76% of the total peaks, and we show that it is a functional SREBP-1 response element. Our analysis also reveals that an Sp1 consensus site is present as a \"coregulatory\" motif in 50% of the SREBP-1 binding peaks, consistent with previous functional studies. SREBP-1 bound not only to many well-characterized SREBP-1 target genes but to several other previously unknown targets in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as many putative target genes in other diverse biological pathways.',\n",

As the monolithic emitter was integrated onto this type of column, the void volume between packing particles and electrospray emitter was eliminated and the electrospray quality was improved. The prepared IMFPC column was applied to proteome analysis of mouse liver extracts, and it was observed that the number of identified proteins and peptides increased 14.9 and 12.9% as well as the peak capacity increased 11.6% by using IMFPC column over conventionally fritless capillary column.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Aging is associated with gradual changes in liver structure, altered metabolites and other physiological/pathological functions in hepatic cells. However, its characterized phenotypes based on altered metabolites and the underlying biological mechanism are unclear. Advancements in high-throughput omics technology provide new opportunities to understand the pathological process of aging. Here, in our present study, both metabolomics and phosphoproteomics were applied to identify the altered metabolites and phosphorylated proteins in liver of young (the WTY group) and naturally aged (the WTA group) mice, to find novel biomarkers and pathways, and uncover the biological mechanism. Analysis showed that the body weights, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased in the WTA group. The grips decreased with age, while the triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) did not change significantly. The increase of fibrosis, accumulation of inflammatory cells, hepatocytes degeneration, the deposition of lipid droplets and glycogen, the damaged mitochondria, and deduction of endoplasmic reticulum were observed in the aging liver under optical and electron microscopes. In addition, a network of metabolites and phosphorylated proteomes of the aging liver was established. Metabolomics detected 970 metabolites in the positive ion mode and 778 metabolites in the negative ion mode. A total of 150 pathways were pooled. Phosphoproteomics identified 2618 proteins which contained 16621 phosphosites. A total of 164 pathways were detected. 65 common pathways were detected in two omics. Phosphorylated protein heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90A) and v-raf murine viral oncogene homolog B1(BRAF), related to cancer pathway, were significantly upregulated in aged mice liver. Western blot verified that protein expression of MEK and ERK, downstream of BRAF pathway were elevated in the liver of aging mice. However, the protein expression of BRAF was not a significant difference. Overall, these findings revealed a close link between aging and cancer and contributed to our understanding of the multi-omics changes in natural aging.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A microfluidic platform based on the integration of denaturation and online immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) digestion for protein pretreatment was first developed on a glass chip. The design of three inlet channels and two groups of snake channel in glass chip can allow the protein solution, the reducing reagent and the alkylating agent to be simultaneously injected into the chip channel and ensured the reaction solution on-line efficient mixing and sufficient reacting. By thiol-ene click chemistry, the capillary-based and glass chip-based trypsin IMER on the surface of poly(trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) monolith were fabricated. The wide range of flow rate tolerance (0.8-5.0 Î¼L/min), and the acceptable reproducibility (RSD% = 3.1%, n = 5) and stability (13.8% decrease of enzyme activity in 2 months) indicated the feasibility of using IMER for online digestion of proteins. Compared with the solution denaturation-offline IMER digestion, the integrated microfluidic platform of chip denaturation-chip IMER and chip denaturation-online IMER have comparable protein identification ability for mouse liver protein with a similar number of protein (798 or 826 vs. 843) and unique peptides (3923 or 4593 vs. 3916). More importantly, the easy and fast digestion of protein samples and possible combination with MS revealed that this microfluidic platform can be a potential method for rapid proteomics analysis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'An outstanding question is how cells control the number and size of membrane organelles. The small GTPase Rab5 has been proposed to be a master regulator of endosome biogenesis. Here, to test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of endosome dependency on Rab5 and validated it by titrating down all three Rab5 isoforms in adult mouse liver using state-of-the-art RNA interference technology. Unexpectedly, the endocytic system was resilient to depletion of Rab5 and collapsed only when Rab5 decreased to a critical level. Loss of Rab5 below this threshold caused a marked reduction in the number of early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes, associated with a block of low-density lipoprotein endocytosis. Loss of endosomes caused failure to deliver apical proteins to the bile canaliculi, suggesting a requirement for polarized cargo sorting. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, the role of Rab5 as an endosome organizer in vivo and reveal the resilience mechanisms of the endocytic system.',\n",

We examined the roles of anti-oxidative sulfur-containing compounds on hepatic damage after spaceflight. We analyzed the livers of mice on board the International Space Station for 30 days. During spaceflight, half of the mice were exposed to artificial earth gravity (1 g) using centrifugation cages. Sulfur-metabolomics of the livers of mice after spaceflight revealed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants (ergothioneine, glutathione, cysteine, taurine, thiamine, etc.) and their intermediates (cysteine sulfonic acid, hercynine, N-acethylserine, serine, etc.) compared to the controls on the ground. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing showed upregulation of gene sets related to oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism, and downregulation of gene sets related to glutathione reducibility in the livers of mice after spaceflight, compared to controls on the ground. These changes were partially mitigated by exposure to 1 g centrifugation. For the first time, we observed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants based on a comprehensive analysis of the livers of mice after spaceflight. Our data suggest that a decrease in sulfur-containing compounds owing to both microgravity and other spaceflight environments (radiation and stressors) contributes to liver damage after spaceflight.',\n",

The existence of physical interactions between insulin receptors and MHC class I antigens was investigated in liver plasma membranes from congenic H-2k mice. Insulin receptors were specifically labeled with a 125I-labeled photoreactive insulin analogue, and cellular proteins were solubilized and incubated with various monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Antibodies reacting with distinct epitopes on H-2k class I antigens were all able to precipitate up to 25% of the labeled insulin receptors in H-2k mouse liver membranes, whereas no insulin receptors were precipitated in H-2b mouse liver membranes. Sequential immunoprecipitations showed that insulin receptors and H-2 antigens were coprecipitated and that no cross-reactivity occurred. The specificity of the interaction between insulin receptors and H-2 antigens was demonstrated after double labeling of membrane proteins by photoreactive insulin and lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. These results thus show that, in mouse liver membranes, insulin receptors are physically associated to class I antigens of the MHC.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Achieving efficient in vivo delivery of siRNA to the appropriate target cell would be a major advance in the use of RNAi in gene function studies and as a therapeutic modality. Hepatocytes, the key parenchymal cells of the liver, are a particularly attractive target cell type for siRNA delivery given their central role in several infectious and metabolic disorders. We have developed a vehicle for the delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo, which we have named siRNA Dynamic PolyConjugates. Key features of the Dynamic PolyConjugate technology include a membrane-active polymer, the ability to reversibly mask the activity of this polymer until it reaches the acidic environment of endosomes, and the ability to target this modified polymer and its siRNA cargo specifically to hepatocytes in vivo after simple, low-pressure i.v. injection. Using this delivery technology, we demonstrate effective knockdown of two endogenous genes in mouse liver: apolipoprotein B (apoB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppara). Knockdown of apoB resulted in clear phenotypic changes that included a significant reduction in serum cholesterol and increased fat accumulation in the liver, consistent with the known functions of apoB. Knockdown of ppara also resulted in a phenotype consistent with its known function, although with less penetrance than observed in apoB knockdown mice. Analyses of serum liver enzyme and cytokine levels in treated mice indicated that the siRNA Dynamic PolyConjugate was nontoxic and well tolerated.',\n",

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of these spontaneous tumors may provide a better understanding of tumor development associated with exposure to chemical carcinogens. In view of the high frequencies of oncogene activation shown in rodent tumors induced by known chemical carcinogens, we have investigated oncogene activation in spontaneous tumors of the B6C3F1 mouse and Fischer 344/N rat by DNA transfection techniques. A marked difference in the presence of activated oncogenes in spontaneous rat tumors versus spontaneous mouse liver tumors was observed in this study. All rat tumors tested failed to yield activated oncogenes (0/29), whereas 30% (3/10) of mouse hepatocellular adenomas and 77% (10/13) of hepatocellular carcinomas scored positive by DNA transfection. These transforming genes were identified as an activated Ha-ras gene in all the adenoma transfectants and in 8 of the 10 carcinoma transfectants. The two remaining hepatocellular carcinomas contained transforming genes that appear not to be members of the known ras gene family. The B6C3F1 mouse liver system might provide a very sensitive assay not only for assessing the potential of a chemical to activate a cellular proto-oncogene, but also for detecting various classes of proto-oncogenes that are susceptible to mutational activation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Dysfunction of cell-cell tight junction (TJ) adhesions is a major feature in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Liver TJs preserve cellular polarity by delimiting functional bile-canalicular structures, forming the blood-biliary barrier. In acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity, the mechanism by which tissue cohesion and polarity are affected remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acetaminophen, even at low-dose, disrupts the integrity of TJ and cell-matrix adhesions, with indicators of cellular stress with liver injury in the human hepatic HepaRG cell line, and primary hepatocytes. In mouse liver, at human-equivalence (therapeutic) doses, dose-dependent loss of intercellular hepatic TJ-associated ZO-1 protein expression was evident with progressive clinical signs of liver injury. Temporal, dose-dependent and specific disruption of the TJ-associated ZO-1 and cytoskeletal-F-actin proteins, correlated with modulation of hepatic ultrastructure. Real-time impedance biosensing verified in vitro early, dose-dependent quantitative decreases in TJ and cell-substrate adhesions. Whereas treatment with NAPQI, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen, or the PKCÎ±-activator and TJ-disruptor phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, similarly reduced TJ integrity, which may implicate oxidative stress and the PKC pathway in TJ destabilization. These findings are relevant to the clinical presentation of acetaminophen-hepatotoxicity and may inform future mechanistic studies to identify specific molecular targets and pathways that may be altered in acetaminophen-induced hepatic depolarization.',\n",

We introduce CoPhMoRe or corona phase molecular recognition as a method of discovering synthetic antibodies, or nanotube-templated recognition sites from a heteropolymer library. We show that certain synthetic heteropolymers, once constrained onto a single-walled carbon nanotube by chemical adsorption, also form a new corona phase that exhibits highly selective recognition for specific molecules. To prove the generality of this phenomenon, we report three examples of heteropolymers-nanotube recognition complexes for riboflavin, L-thyroxine and estradiol. The platform opens new opportunities to create synthetic recognition sites for molecular detection. We have also extended this molecular recognition technique to neurotransmitters, producing the first fluorescent sensor for dopamine. Another area of advancement in biosensor development is the use of near infrared fluorescent carbon nanotube sensors for in-vivo detection. Here, we show that PEG-ligated d(AAAT)<SUB>7</SUB> DNA wrapped SWNT are selective for nitric oxide, a vasodilator of blood vessels, and can be tail vein injected into mice and localized within the viable mouse liver.

We report (i) direct detection of NAPQI formed as an oxidation product of acetaminophen by cytochrome P-450 and cumene hydroperoxide and (ii) indirect evidence that is compelling for NAPQI formation from acetaminophen by cytochrome P-450, NADPH, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Evidence is provided for the rapid reduction of NAPQI back to acetaminophen by NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase such that steady-state levels of NAPQI were below our detection limits of 6.7 X 10(-8) M. In mouse liver microsomal incubations, radiolabeled analogs of both NAPQI and acetaminophen bound covalently to microsomal protein with the loss of approximately equal to 20% of the acetyl group as acetamide. The binding in each case was decreased by glutathione with concomitant formation of 3-S-glutathionylacetaminophen. The binding also was decreased by L-ascorbic acid, NADPH, and NADH with reduction of NAPQI to acetaminophen. Results of partitioning experiments indicate that NAPQI is a major metabolite of acetaminophen, a considerable fraction of which is rapidly reduced back to acetaminophen.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Laminin, a basement membrane glycoprotein isolated from cultures of mouse endodermal cells and rat yolk sac carcinoma cells, promoted the attachment of liver cells obtained from regenerating mouse liver. Cells from normal mouse liver attached readily to dishes coated with fibronectin but attached poorly to surfaces coated with laminin. Both proteins efficiently promoted the attachment of cells from livers undergoing regeneration. After regeneration, the attachment to laminin returned to the low levels found in animals not subjected to partial hepatectomy but attachment to fibronectin remained high. Immunofluorescent staining of sections of normal liver with antilaminin revealed the presence of laminin in or adjacent to the walls of the bile ducts and blood vessels. After induction of regeneration by partial hepatectomy, increased amounts of laminin appeared in the sinusoidal areas. After carbon tetrachloride poisoning, staining for laminin was especially pronounced in the necrotic and postnecrotic areas around the central veins. This additional expression of laminin was transient. It reached a maximum around 5-6 days after the injury and then gradually disappeared. These findings show that laminin is an adhesive protein. The increase of laminin in regenerating liver and the adhesiveness of cells from such livers to laminin suggest a role for laminin in the maintenance of a proper tissue organization during liver regeneration.',\n",

Although it has been known that MH induces adverse effects in the body due to grayanotoxin (GTX) in it, it is widely used for some medical purposes by the public. In this study, the effects of MH (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) and GTX-III (0.01 mg/kg), which is the pure form of the most toxic type of the GTXs in MH, were investigated on the mouse liver at molecular level via Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The results showed that 25 and 50 mg/kg of MH didn't cause any significant alterations in the liver tissue except a decrease in the glycogen amount. However, significant differences were observed between 75 mg/kg MH and GTX-III treated groups and control group. For example, the amounts of saturated lipids, nucleic acids and proteins increased in the 75 mg/kg MH and GTX-III treated groups. A decrease in the ratios of unsaturated/saturated lipid, CH<SUB>2</SUB>/lipid and carbonyl/lipid and an increase in the ratio of CH<SUB>3</SUB>/lipid were observed after the administration of 75 mg/kg MH and GTX-III, all of which may be a consequence of lipid peroxidation. Moreover, 75 mg/kg MH and GTX-III caused a decrease in the membrane order, an increase in the membrane fluidity and some important changes on the secondary structure of proteins indicating protein denaturation. In addition, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed these findings. These results revealed that MH induces significant dose-dependent toxic effects in the structure and function of the liver tissue. This study also showed that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy provides a rapid and sensitive monitoring of the changes induced by a toxic compound on biological tissues at molecular level.\",\n",

Microscopy techniques used to image tissue NPs are limited by complicated sample preparation or poor resolution. In this study, we developed a laser ablation (LA) system coupled to single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) for quantitative imaging of gold (G)NPs in tissue samples. In this system, GNPs were ablated but did not disintegrate and integrate under optimised operation conditions, which were verified by characterising LA particles by scanning electron microscopy. The feasibility of imaging size distributions in tissue was validated using reference GNPs 60 and 80 nm in size on matrix-matched kidney. A transport efficiency of 6.07% was obtained by LA-SP-ICP-MS under optimal conditions. We used this system to image 80-nm GNPs in mouse liver and the size distribution thus obtained was in accordance with that determined by nebuliser SP-ICP-MS. The images revealed that 80-nm GNPs mainly accumulate in the liver and did not obviously aggregate. Our results demonstrate that LA-SP-ICP-MS is an effective tool for evaluating the size distribution of metal NPs in tissue.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'To-date, most proteomic studies aimed at discovering tissue-based cancer biomarkers have compared the quantity of selected proteins between case and control groups. However, proteins generally function in association with other proteins to form modules localized in particular subcellular compartments in specialized cell types and tissues. Sub-cellular mislocalization of proteins has in fact been detected as a key feature in a variety of cancer cells. Here, we describe a strategy for tissue-biomarker detection based on a mitochondrial fold enrichment (mtFE) score, which is sensitive to protein abundance changes as well as changes in subcellular distribution between mitochondria and cytosol. The mtFE score integrates protein abundance data from total cellular lysates and mitochondria-enriched fractions, and provides novel information for the classification of cancer samples that is not necessarily apparent from conventional abundance measurements alone. We apply this new strategy to a panel of wild-type and mutant mice with a liver-specific gene deletion of Liver receptor homolog 1 (Lrh-1<SUP>hep-/-</SUP>), with both lines containing control individuals as well as individuals with liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Lrh-1 gene deletion attenuates cancer cell metabolism in hepatocytes through mitochondrial glutamine processing. We show that proteome changes based on mtFE scores outperform protein abundance measurements in discriminating DEN-induced liver cancer from healthy liver tissue, and are uniquely robust against genetic perturbation. We validate the capacity of selected proteins with informative mtFE scores to indicate hepatic malignant changes in two independent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thus demonstrating the robustness of this new approach to biomarker research. Overall, the method provides a novel, sensitive approach to cancer biomarker discovery that considers contextual information of tested proteins.',\n",

We have found previously that macrophages secrete the hormone cachectin, which specifically suppresses LPL activity in cultured adipocytes (3T3-L1 cells)<SUP>10-17</SUP>.

A receptor for cachectin was identified on non-tumorigenic cultured cells and on normal mouse liver membranes<SUP>17</SUP>. A new high-yield purification technique has enabled us to determine further details of the structure of mouse cachectin. We now report that a high degree of homology exists between the N-terminal sequence of mouse cachectin and the N-terminal sequence recently determined for human tumour necrosis factor (TNF)<SUP>18,19</SUP>. Purified cachectin also possesses potent TNF activity in vitro. These findings suggest that the `cachectin' and `TNF' activities of murine macrophage conditioned medium are attributable to a single protein, which modulates the metabolic activities of normal as well as neoplastic cells through interaction with specific high-affinity receptors.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'B6C3F1 mice exposed to high dose levels of methylene chloride by inhalation for 2 years had an elevated incidence of liver and lung tumours. These tumours were not increased in rats or hamsters exposed under the same or similar conditions. This paper gives an overview of research conducted over the last 10 years into the mechanism of action of methylene chloride as a mouse carcinogen and into the relevance of the mouse data to humans exposed to this chemical. Data are presented on the comparative metabolism and pharmacokinetics of methylene chloride in mice, rats, hamsters and humans, on the toxicity of methylene chloride to the target organs in the mouse, and on the genotoxicity of methylene chloride in vitro and in vivo. The enzyme which activates methylene chloride to its carcinogenic form has been isolated, sequenced, and cloned, and its distribution studied within cells, organs and between species. Evidence has been obtained to show that methylene chloride caused cancer in mice as a result of interactions between metabolites of the glutathione S-transferase pathway and DNA. Damage to mouse lung Clara cells and increased cell division are believed to have influenced the development of the lung tumours. The species specificity was a direct consequence of the very high activity and specific cellular and nuclear localisation of a theta class glutathione S-transferase enzyme which was unique to the mouse. Consequently, DNA damage was not detectable in rats in vivo, or in hamster and human hepatocytes exposed to cytotoxic dose levels of methylene chloride in vitro. These results provide evidence that the mouse is unique in its response to methylene chloride and that it is an inappropriate model for human health assessment.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Large-scale proteomic approaches have identified numerous mitochondrial acetylated proteins; however in most cases, their regulation by acetyltransferases and deacetylases remains unclear. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an NAD<SUP>+</SUP>-dependent mitochondrial protein deacetylase that has been shown to regulate a limited number of enzymes in key metabolic pathways. Here, we use a rigorous label-free quantitative MS approach (called MS1 Filtering) to analyze changes in lysine acetylation from mouse liver mitochondria in the absence of SIRT3. Among 483 proteins, a total of 2,187 unique sites of lysine acetylation were identified after affinity enrichment. MS1 Filtering revealed that lysine acetylation of 283 sites in 136 proteins was significantly increased in the absence of SIRT3 (at least twofold). A subset of these sites was independently validated using selected reaction monitoring MS. These data show that SIRT3 regulates acetylation on multiple proteins, often at multiple sites, across several metabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, amino acid catabolism, and the urea and tricarboxylic acid cycles, as well as mitochondrial regulatory proteins. The widespread modification of key metabolic pathways greatly expands the number of known substrates and sites that are targeted by SIRT3 and establishes SIRT3 as a global regulator of mitochondrial protein acetylation with the capability of coordinating cellular responses to nutrient status and energy homeostasis.',\n",

In cells, we demonstrate that Lys residues, besides Glu, Asp and Arg residues, are the dominant in vivo targets of ADP-ribosylation during oxidative stress. In normal liver tissue, we find Arg residues to be the predominant modification site. The cellular distribution and biological processes that involve ADP-ribosylated proteins are different in cultured cells and liver tissue, in the latter of which the majority of sites were found to be in cytosolic and mitochondrial protein networks primarily associated with metabolism.

It kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA, and hence cellular DNA repair capacity is an important determinant of its efficacy. Here, we investigated the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage in mouse liver and testis tissue extracts prepared at regular intervals over the course of a day. We find that the XPA protein, which plays an essential role in repair of cisplatin damage by nucleotide excision repair, exhibits circadian oscillation in the liver but not in testis. Consequently, removal of cisplatin adducts in liver extracts, but not in testis extracts, exhibits a circadian pattern with zenith at â¼5 pm and nadir at â¼5 am. Furthermore, we find that the circadian oscillation of XPA is achieved both by regulation of transcription by the core circadian clock proteins including cryptochrome and by regulation at the posttranslational level by the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. These findings may be used as a guide for timing of cisplatin chemotherapy.',\n",

FIT1 and FIT2 are endoplasmic reticulum resident membrane proteins that induce lipid droplet accumulation in cell culture and when expressed in mouse liver. shRNA silencing of FIT2 in 3T3-LI adipocytes prevents accumulation of lipid droplets, and depletion of FIT2 in zebrafish blocks diet-induced accumulation of lipid droplets in the intestine and liver, highlighting an important role for FIT2 in lipid droplet formation in vivo.

However, whether LPS/D-GalN are genotoxic has been left unknown. In this study, male mice were divided into eight groups with eight animals in each group. For acute challenge of LPS/D-GalN, the mice in each group received a combination of LPS/D-GalN via intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 25 Î¼g/kg/250 mg/kg, 25 Î¼g/kg/500 mg/kg, or 50 Î¼g/kg/500 mg/kg body weight. An additional group for chronic administration of test compounds was conducted by i.p. injection of LPS/D-GalN (10 Î¼g/kg/100 mg/kg) every other day for 8 weeks. Saline solution (0.9%) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) (50 mg/kg body weight) given by i.p. injection was used as the negative and positive control, respectively. The results of single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay indicated that acute exposure of the mice to LPS/D-GalN caused severe DNA damage in hepatic cells, but not in the brain, sperm or bone marrow cells, which evidenced the genotoxicity of LPS/D-GalN administrated in combination. Interestingly, the chronic administration of LPS/D-GalN triggered significant genotoxic effects not only in hepatic but also in brain cells, with negative results in sperm and bone marrow cells. Histopathological examination in the liver and brain tissues revealed changes consistent with the SCGE results.

       "    'abstract': \"Currently, few studies are available that have explored the role of carbon nanoparticles in liver toxicity. The susceptibility of the liver to nanoparticles rises from the inhalation exposure route often encountered during manufacturing and occupational exposure. Persons occupying these types of environmental setting are exposed to airborne nanoparticles less than 100nm, which have unobstructed access to most area of the lungs due to their size. Several reports have shown that single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) induce oxidative stress and pose the greatest cytotoxicity potential do to their size. Also, studies in mice indicate nanoparticles tend to accumulate in organs such as the spleen, kidney and liver, which is a major concern due to a lack of knowledge as to their fate. Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT's) are able to more easily penetrate through the cell membrane and display higher cell toxicity than Multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCTs), opening the possibility for crossing various biological barriers within the body. Therefore effective occupational and environmental health risk assessments are significant in controlling the manufacture process of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The present study was undertaken to determine the toxicity exhibited by SWCNT in mouse liver tissue as a model system. Mouse exposure during inhalation with and without SWCNT and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products were measured by change in fluorescence using dichloro fluorescein (DCF). The result showed no increase ROS on exposure of SWCNT in a dose and time dependent manner. Also, there is no reduction levels of glutathione (GSH) and super oxide dismutase (SOD), the antioxidant protective mechanism present in mouse liver cells upon SWCNT exposure. Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assays indicated no tissue or protein damage. Additionally, Caspases --8 and --3 assays were conducted in order to understand the apoptotic signaling pathways initiated by oxidative stress. PEPCK and Hexokinase activity in mouse liver measured no hepatic glucokinase activity within the sensitivity of the assays. Based on the assays performed, the liver tolerated the SWCNT's 5mug dosage for 7 days, with no acute toxic effect. Although current tests and procedures may be appropriate to detect many risks associated with the use of these nanoparticles, it cannot be assumed that these assays will detect all potential risks. Given their limitations, specific emphasis should be on investigation in term of distribution in vivo both at the organ and cellular level using proteomics.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. In order to enable the noninvasive detection of small liver tumors in mice, we present a parallel iterative shrinkage (PIS) algorithm for dual-modality tomography. It takes advantage of microcomputed tomography and multiview bioluminescence imaging, providing anatomical structure and bioluminescence intensity information to reconstruct the size and location of tumors. By incorporating prior knowledge of signal sparsity, we associate some mathematical strategies including specific smooth convex approximation, an iterative shrinkage operator, and affine subspace with the PIS method, which guarantees the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability for three-dimensional reconstruction. Then an in vivo experiment on the bead-implanted mouse has been performed to validate the feasibility of this method. The findings indicate that a tiny lesion less than 3 mm in diameter can be localized with a position bias no more than 1 mm the computational efficiency is one to three orders of magnitude faster than the existing algorithms; this approach is robust to the different regularization parameters and the l<SUB>p</SUB> norms. Finally, we have applied this algorithm to another in vivo experiment on an HCCLM3 orthotopic xenograft mouse model, which suggests the PIS method holds the promise for practical applications of whole-body cancer detection.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The transglutaminase (TG) family comprises eight isozymes that form the isopeptide bonds between glutamine and lysine residues and contribute to the fibrotic diseases via crosslinking-mediated stabilization of ECM and the activation of TGF-Î² in several tissues. However, despite a growing body of evidence implicating TG2 as a key enzyme in fibrosis, the causative role of TG2 and the involvement of the other isozymes have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, here we clarified the distributions of TG isozymes and their in situ activities and identified the isozyme-specific possible substrates for both TG1 and TG2 using their substrate peptides in mouse fibrotic liver. We found that TG1 activity was markedly enhanced intracellularly over a widespread area, whereas TG2 activity increased in the extracellular space. In total, 43 and 42 possible substrates were identified for TG1 and TG2, respectively, as involved in chromatin organization and cellular component morphogenesis. These included keratin 18, a biomarker for hepatic injury, which was accumulated in the fibrotic liver and showed the partly similar distribution with TG1 activity. These findings suggest that TG1 activity may be involved in the functional modification of intracellular proteins, whereas TG2 activity contributes to the stabilization of extracellular proteins during liver fibrosis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Although recombinant adenovirus vectors offer a very efficient means by which to transfer genetic information into cells in vivo, antigen-dependent immunity limits the duration of gene expression and prevents retreatment. Recombinant murine CTLA4Ig and anti-CD40 ligand antibody block costimulatory interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells. We previously reported that murine CTLA4Ig prolongs adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, but does not allow for secondary expression after readministration of the vector. In studies described here, when anti-CD40 ligand and recombinant murine CTLA4Ig were coadministered around the time of primary vector administration (i) prolonged adenovirus-mediated gene expression (length of experiment up to 1 year) from the livers of &gt;90% of treated mice was observed, and (ii) secondary adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was achieved in &gt;50% of the mice even after the immunosuppressive effects of these agents were no longer present. Nearly two-thirds of these mice had persistent secondary gene expression lasting for at least 200-300 days. Neither agent alone allowed transduction after secondary vector administration. Treated mice had decreased immune responses to the vector as shown by markedly decreased production of neutralizing antibodies, diminished spleen proliferation responses and IFN-Î³ production in vitro, and reduced T cell infiltrates in the liver. These results suggest that it may be possible to obtain persistence as well as secondary adenoviral-mediated gene transfer with transient immunosuppressive therapies.',\n",

This response is LiNKT-specific, since neither lung nor splenic tissue-resident iNKT cells from Î±GalCer/CD1d-NP-treated mice produce IL-10 or IL-21. Additionally, these LiNKTR1 cells suppress autoantigen presentation, and recognize CD1d expressed on conventional B cells to induce IL-10+IL-35-producing regulatory B (Breg) cells, leading to the suppression of liver and pancreas autoimmunity. Our results thus suggest that LiNKT cells are plastic for further functional diversification, with such plasticity potentially targetable for suppressing tissue-specific inflammatory phenomena.',\n",

Here we report that epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling of quiescent and regenerating mouse livers define chromatin states that dictate gene expression and transposon repression. We integrate ATACseq and DNA methylation profiling with ChIPseq for the histone marks H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 and the histone variant H2AZ to identify 6 chromatin states with distinct functional characteristics. We show that genes involved in proliferation reside in active states, but are marked with H3K27me3 and silenced in quiescent livers. We find that during regeneration, H3K27me3 is depleted from their promoters, facilitating their dynamic expression. These findings demonstrate that hepatic chromatin states in quiescent livers predict gene expression and that pro-regenerative genes are maintained in active chromatin states, but are restrained by H3K27me3, permitting a rapid and synchronized response during regeneration.',\n",

Liver homogenates of adult C3H female mice incubated with 1-1000 nM prostaglandin A1, A2, B2, F1 alpha, 6-keto-F1 alpha, E1, E2, I2, or thromboxane B2 provided the 100,000 X g membrane pellets for subsequent ovine prolactin binding and membrane fluidity studies. Only membrane preparations treated with prostaglandin I2 showed an increase in specific binding of ovine prolactin. The effect (40-50%) was maximal at 100 nM prostaglandin I2 after 30 min of incubation and was due to an increase in the number of receptor sites. Under the same conditions, prostaglandin I2 induced a 17% decrease in membrane microviscosity. These data suggest that specific prostaglandins may modulate the number of prolactin receptors in vivo by modifying the fluidity of the lipid bilayer and the subsequent ease with which receptors can assume active configurations within the matrix.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In the interphase nucleus, chromatin is organized into three-dimensional conformation to coordinate genome functions. The lamina-chromatin association is important to facilitate higher-order chromatin in mammalian cells, but its biological significances and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. One obstacle is that the list of lamina-associated proteins remains limited, presumably due to the inherent insolubility of lamina proteins. In this report, we identified 182 proteins associated with lamin B1 (a constitutive component of lamina) in mouse hepatocytes, by adopting virus-based proximity-dependent biotin identification. These proteins are functionally related to biological processes such as chromatin organization. As an example, we validated the association between lamin B1 and core histone macroH2A1, a histone associated with repressive chromatin. Furthermore, we mapped Lamina-associated domains (LADs) in mouse liver cells and found that boundaries of LADs are enriched for macroH2A. More interestingly, knocking-down of macroH2A1 resulted in the release of heterochromatin foci marked by histone lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and the decondensation of global chromatin structure. However, down-regulation of lamin B1 led to redistribution of macroH2A1. Taken together, our data indicated that macroH2A1 is associated with lamina and is required to maintain chromatin architecture in mouse liver cells.',\n",

To study the origin and properties of this cell population, oval cell proliferation was induced in adult mouse liver by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) and a method for their isolation was developed. Transplantation into fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) deficient mice was used to determine their capacity for liver repopulation. In competitive repopulation experiments, hepatic oval cells were at least as efficient as mature hepatocytes in repopulating the liver. In mice with chimeric livers, the oval cells were not derived from hepatocytes but from liver nonparenchymal cells. This finding supports a model in which intrahepatic progenitors differentiate into hepatocytes irreversibly. To determine whether oval cells originated from stem cells residing in the bone marrow, bone marrow transplanted wild-type mice were treated with DDC for 8 months and oval cells were then serially transferred into Fah mutants. The liver repopulating cells in these secondary transplant recipients lacked the genetic markers of the original bone marrow donor. We conclude that hepatic oval cells do not originate in bone marrow but in the liver itself, and that they have valuable properties for therapeutic liver repopulation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The importance of glucokinase (GK; EC 2.7.1.12) in glucose homeostasis has been demonstrated by the association of GK mutations with diabetes mellitus in humans and by alterations in glucose metabolism in transgenic and gene knockout mice. Liver GK activity in humans and rodents is allosterically inhibited by GK regulatory protein (GKRP). To further understand the role of GKRP in GK regulation, the mouse GKRP gene was inactivated. With the knockout of the GKRP gene, there was a parallel loss of GK protein and activity in mutant mouse liver. The loss was primarily because of posttranscriptional regulation of GK, indicating a positive regulatory role for GKRP in maintaining GK levels and activity. As in rat hepatocytes, both GK and GKRP were localized in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes cultured in low-glucose-containing medium. In the presence of fructose or high concentrations of glucose, conditions known to relieve GK inhibition by GKRP in vitro, only GK was translocated into the cytoplasm. In the GKRP-mutant hepatocytes, GK was not found in the nucleus under any tested conditions. We propose that GKRP functions as an anchor to sequester and inhibit GK in the hepatocyte nucleus, where it is protected from degradation. This ensures that glucose phosphorylation is minimal when the liver is in the fasting, glucose-producing phase. This also enables the hepatocytes to rapidly mobilize GK into the cytoplasm to phosphorylate and store or metabolize glucose after the ingestion of dietary glucose. In GKRP-mutant mice, the disruption of this regulation and the subsequent decrease in GK activity leads to altered glucose metabolism and impaired glycemic control.',\n",

Here we show that hepatitis B virus (HBV), a pathogen that chronically infects â350 million people globally, can enhance autophagic response in cell cultures, mouse liver, and during natural infection. This enhancement of the autophagic response is not coupled by an increase of autophagic protein degradation and is dependent on the viral X protein, which binds to and enhances the enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III, an enzyme critical for the initiation of autophagy. Further analysis indicates that autophagy enhances HBV DNA replication, with minimal involvement of late autophagic vacuoles in this process. Our studies thus demonstrate that a DNA virus can use autophagy to enhance its own replication and indicate the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of HBV patients.',\n",

AMS is a highly sensitive method for counting long-lived but rare cosmogenic isotopes. While AMS is a tool of importance in the earth sciences, it has not been applied in biomedical research. The ability of AMS to assay rare isotope concentrations (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 41Ca, and 129I) in microgram amounts suggests that extension to the biomedical sciences is a natural and potentially powerful application of the technology. In this study, the relationship between exposure to low levels of 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl[2-14C]imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and formation of DNA adducts is examined to establish the dynamic range of the technique and the potential sensitivity for biological measurements, as well as to evaluate the relationship between DNA adducts and low-dose carcinogen exposure. Instrument reproducibility in this study is 2%; sensitivity is 1 adduct per 10(11) nucleotides. Formation of adducts is linearly dependent on dose down to an exposure of 500 ng per kg of body weight. With the present measurements, we demonstrate at least 1 order of magnitude improvement over the best adduct detection sensitivity reported to date and 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement over other methods used for adduct measurement. An additional improvement of 2 orders of magnitude in sensitivity is suggested by preliminary experiments to develop bacterial hosts depleted in radiocarbon. Expanded applications involving human subjects, including clinical applications, are now expected because of the great detection sensitivity and small sample size requirements of AMS.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The gap junctional protein connexin32 is expressed in hepatocytes, exocrine pancreatic cells, Schwann cells, and other cell types. We have inactivated the connexin32 gene by homologous recombination in the mouse genome and have generated homozygous connexin32-deficient mice that were viable and fertile but weighed on the average approximately 17% less than wild-type controls. Electrical stimulation of sympathetic nerves in connexin32-deficient liver triggered a 78% lower amount of glucose mobilization from glycogen stores, when compared with wild-type liver. Thus, connexin32-containing gap junctions are essential in mouse liver for maximal intercellular propagation of the noradrenaline signal from the periportal (upstream) area, where it is received from sympathetic nerve endings, to perivenous (downstream) hepatocytes. In connexin32-defective liver, the amount of connexin26 protein expressed was found to be lower than in wild-type liver, and the total area of gap junction plaques was approximately 1000-fold smaller than in wild-type liver. In contrast to patients with connexin32 defects suffering from X chromosome-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) due to demyelination in Schwann cells of peripheral nerves, connexin32-deficient mice did not show neurological abnormalities when analyzed at 3 months of age. It is possible, however, that they may develop neurodegenerative symptoms at older age.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Relaxin is an antifibrotic peptide hormone previously assumed to directly reverse the activation of hepatic stellate cells for liver fibrosis resolution. Using nanoparticle-mediated delivery, here we show that, although relaxin gene therapy reduces liver fibrosis in vivo, in vitro treatment fails to induce quiescence of the activated hepatic stellate cells. We show that hepatic macrophages express the primary relaxin receptor, and that, on relaxin binding, they switch from the profibrogenic to the pro-resolution phenotype. The latter releases exosomes that promote the relaxin-mediated quiescence of activated hepatic stellate cells through miR-30a-5p. Building on these results, we developed lipid nanoparticles that preferentially target activated hepatic stellate cells in the fibrotic liver and encapsulate the relaxin gene and miR-30a-5p mimic. The combinatorial gene therapy achieves synergistic antifibrosis effects in models of mouse liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings highlight the key role that macrophages play in the relaxin-primed alleviation of liver fibrosis and demonstrate a proof-of-concept approach to devise antifibrotic strategies through the complementary application of nanotechnology and basic science.',\n",

The cell-autonomous clock is governed by an interlocked network of transcriptional feedback loops. Hundreds of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) regulate tissue specific functions. Transcriptome studies reveal that different organs (e.g. liver, heart, adrenal gland) feature substantially varying sets of CCGs with different peak phase distributions. To study the phase variability of CCGs in mammalian peripheral tissues, we develop a core clock model for mouse liver and adrenal gland based on expression profiles and known cis-regulatory sites. `Modulation factors' associated with E-boxes, ROR-elements, and D-boxes can explain variable rhythms of CCGs, which is demonstrated for differential regulation of cytochromes P450 and 12 h harmonics. By varying model parameters we explore how tissue-specific peak phase distributions can be generated. The central role of E-boxes and ROR-elements is confirmed by analysing ChIP-seq data of BMAL1 and REV-ERB transcription factors.\",\n",

Recently, it has been suggested that hepatocytes might have the potential to transdifferentiate or dedifferentiate under physiological or pathological conditions in vivo. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocytes in liver fibrosis has also been proposed. However, these findings have not been fully confirmed. In this study, hepatocytes were genetically labelled for cell fate tracing using lacZ via the tamoxifen-induced CreERT/loxP system. After induction with tamoxifen, alb + cells were permanently marked by lacZ expression, and all progeny lacZ + cells were derived from a single source with no interference. We did not observe transdifferentiation or dedifferentiation of hepatocytes into cholangiocytes or hepatic progenitor cells under conditions of liver homeostasis or following a 2/3 partial hepatectomy. Meanwhile, lacZ/OPN-positive cells were observed in livers of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-fed mice, and lacZ/alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells were detected in carbon tetrachloride-induced chronic liver injury models. These results suggested that some existing differentiated alb + cells might have the potential of transdifferentiation/dedifferentiation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in vivo in some liver injury models, but the proportion of these alb + cells in liver was very low, and their significance and actual function during the pathological process remains to be elucidated.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Due to breakthroughs in RNAi and genome editing methods in the past decade, it is now easier than ever to study fine details of protein synthesis in animal models. However, most of our understanding of translation comes from unicellular organisms and cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of perturbing protein synthesis in a mouse liver by targeting translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) with RNAi. We were able to achieve over 90% knockdown efficacy and maintain it for 2 weeks effectively slowing down the rate of translation elongation. As the total protein yield declined, both proteomics and ribosome profiling assays showed robust translational upregulation of ribosomal proteins relative to other proteins. Although all these genes bear the TOP regulatory motif, the branch of the mTOR pathway responsible for translation regulation was not activated. Paradoxically, coordinated translational upregulation of ribosomal proteins only occurred in the liver but not in murine cell culture. Thus, the upregulation of ribosomal transcripts likely occurred via passive mTOR-independent mechanisms. Impaired elongation sequesters ribosomes on mRNA and creates a shortage of free ribosomes. This leads to preferential translation of transcripts with high initiation rates such as ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, severe eEF2 shortage reduces the negative impact of positively charged amino acids frequent in ribosomal proteins on ribosome progression.',\n",

These results are demonstrated not only in tissue-mimic phantoms but also in actual tissues, such as porcine muscle, ex vivo mouse liver, ex vivo spleen, and in vivo mouse tissue. These results are achieved based on three unique technologies: excellent near infrared ultrasound-switchable fluorescence (USF) contrast agents, a sensitive USF imaging system, and an effective correlation method. Multiplex USF fluorescence imaging is also achieved. It is useful to simultaneously image multiple targets and observe their interactions.

       "    'abstract': 'Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol; APAP) is a mild analgesic and antipyretic used commonly worldwide. Although APAP is considered a safe and effective over-the-counter medication, it is also the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Its hepatotoxicity has been linked to the covalent binding of its reactive metabolite, N-acetyl p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), to proteins. The aim of this in vivo study was to identify APAP-protein targets in both rat and mouse liver, and to compare the results from both species, using bottom-up proteomics and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments. Livers from rats and mice, treated with APAP, were homogenized and digested by trypsin. Digests were then fractionated by mixed-mode solid-phase extraction prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition. The targeted assays were optimized based on high-resolution MS/MS data from information-dependent acquisition (IDA) using control liver homogenates treated with a custom alkylating reagent forming a positional isomer of the APAP modification on all cysteine residues, in order to build an in-house modified peptide database for targeted analysis. A list of putative in vivo targets of APAP were screened from previous in vitro studies, data-dependent high-resolution MS/MS analyses of liver digests, as well as selected proteins from the target protein database (TPDB), an online resource which references previous reports of proteins found to be modified by acetaminophen. Multiple protein targets of APAP in each species were found, while confirming modification sites. Several proteins were found to be modified in both species, including ATP-citrate synthase, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1, cytochrome P450 2C6/29, mitochondrial glutamine amidotransferase-like protein/ES1 protein homolog, glutamine synthetase, microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1, mitochondrial-processing peptidase, methanethiol oxidase, protein/nucleic acid deglycase DJ-1, triosephosphate isomerase and thioredoxin. The targeted method afforded better reproducibility for analysing these low-abundant modified peptides in highly complex samples compared to traditional data-dependent experiments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Mouse Slp, a duplicate of the fourth complement component (C4) gene, exhibits EDTA-independent complement activity with a hepatic expression that is male specific. To provide an underlying mechanism for the male-specific expression, we have analyzed the promoter activity of the various 5'-flanking sequences and CpG demethylation of the Slp gene. Transient transfections using HepG2 cells indicate that the element TTCCGGGC (nt -124 to -117) regulates the promoter activity. Moreover, CpG at position -121 of this regulatory element is demethylated to a much higher degree in males than in females. This sexually dimorphic DNA demethylation is consistent with the male-specific expression of the Slp gene in DBA/2 males. The regulatory element binds to the different TTCCGGGC-specific nuclear proteins depending on the methylation of the CpG site. In contrast, the corresponding CpG at position -119 of the C4 gene, which is expressed in both males and females, is demethylated at equal and high levels in both sexes. We therefore propose that the DNA demethylation and methylation-sensitive transcription factors may be a part of the regulatory mechanism for the male-specific expression of the Slp gene.\",\n",

Unlike the suprachiasmatic nucleus clock that is set by light and drives rest-activity and fasting-feeding cycles, peripheral clocks are set by daily feeding, suggesting that at least some contribute metabolic regulation. The liver plays a well known role in glucose homeostasis, and we report here that mice with a liver-specific deletion of Bmal1, an essential clock component, exhibited hypoglycemia restricted to the fasting phase of the daily feeding cycle, exaggerated glucose clearance, and loss of rhythmic expression of hepatic glucose regulatory genes. We conclude that the liver clock is important for buffering circulating glucose in a time-of-day-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the liver clock contributes to homeostasis by driving a daily rhythm of hepatic glucose export that counterbalances the daily cycle of glucose ingestion resulting from the fasting-feeding cycle.',\n",

Whether the organs are healthy or not requires a professional doctor to examine the reconstructed image and judge from his or her own experience. The purpose of this paper is to identify the cirrhotic mouse liver and normal mouse liver with hyperspectral x-ray CT (HXCT) and machine learning. HXCT is proposed to reconstruct the x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) characteristics of a single pixel in the reconstructed mouse liver images. HXCT uses a cadmium telluride photon counter as the x-ray detector, which can improve the spectral resolution and separate spectral lines. Filtered back-projection and algebra reconstruction technique reconstruction algorithms are used for image and XAS reconstruction. In the machine learning model, principal component analysis is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of XAS. Besides, the neural network algorithm Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to train and identify the reconstructed XAS of two different kinds of livers. These two different mouse livers can be well recognized since the accuracy goes to almost 100% based on ANN. It is feasible to employ the machine learning algorithm to identify the XAS of different mouse livers.',\n",

This approach utilizes the simultaneous bright and dark field imaging capabilities of STEM along with careful control of the image contrast settings to readily identify PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs in mouse liver tissue without the need for additional time-consuming analytical characterization. We utilized this technique to analyze 243,000 Î¼m3 of mouse liver tissue for the presence of PEG-R-Si-Au-NPs.

This inverse relationship between the two data sets was also observed for pathway activities. Functional network analysis showed that biological functions associated with diabetes and lipid metabolism were commonly enriched in both data sets. We also observed a similarity in distribution of cmap enrichment scores between db/db mouse liver and human diabetic liver, whereas there was an inverse pattern of cmap enrichment scores in human diabetic liver compared with ESB-treated HepG2 cells. This relationship might explain the pharmacological activities of ESB against db/db mouse and possible effectiveness of ESB against human diabetes.

       "    'abstract': 'Cisâdiamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) is a well characterized antitumor drug used for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. The cytotoxicity of cisplatin is mainly mediated through the formation of DNA adducts, which are also believed to be responsible for the secondary malignancies produced by the drug. The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo mutagenic activity of cisplatin in the lacZ plasmidâbased transgenic mouse model. The mutant frequency (MF) and the spectrum of mutations induced by cisplatin in the mouse liver were analyzed and compared to controls. The mean MF in the lacZ gene was increased 2âfold in mice treated with a single 6 mg/kg body weight dose of cisplatin and sacrificed after 17 and 28 days (P = 0.001 and P &lt; 0.0001). Restriction analysis and sequencing of mutant DNA showed that cisplatin was able to induce both large deletions and point mutations. A specific profile of base substitution and frameshift mutations was identified in treated mice, consisting primarily of G:CâA:T transitions at GpG and ApG sites, the preferential DNA binding sites of cisplatin, and single basepair deletions/insertions. The present results provide the first evidence that cisplatin has mutagenic activity in vivo and induces a characteristic pattern of mutations in the mouse liver. This mutagenicity may be responsible for its tumorigenic activity. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 40:283â291, 2002.',\n",

To this effect, posttranslational modifications of clock proteins modulate circadian rhythms and are thought to convert physiological signals into changes in protein regulatory function. To explore reversible lysine acetylation that is dependent on the clock, we have characterized the circadian acetylome in WT and Clock-deficient (Clock<SUP>-/-</SUP>) mouse liver by quantitative mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed that a number of mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic pathways are heavily influenced by clock-driven acetylation. Pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism were found to be highly enriched hits. The significant number of metabolic pathways whose protein acetylation profile is altered in Clock<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice prompted us to link the acetylome to the circadian metabolome previously characterized in our laboratory. Changes in enzyme acetylation over the circadian cycle and the link to metabolite levels are discussed, revealing biological implications connecting the circadian clock to cellular metabolic state.',\n",

In this model, the unliganded TR forms stable, chromatin-bound complexes with transcriptional co-repressors to repress transcription. Binding of hormone dissociates co-repressors and facilitates recruitment of co-activators to activate transcription. Here we show that in addition to hormone-independent TR occupancy, ChIP-seq against endogenous TR in mouse liver tissue demonstrates considerable hormone-induced TR recruitment to chromatin associated with chromatin remodelling and activated gene transcription. Genome-wide footprinting analysis using DNase-seq provides little evidence for TR footprints both in the absence and presence of hormone, suggesting that unliganded TR engagement with repressive complexes on chromatin is, similar to activating receptor complexes, a highly dynamic process. This dynamic and ligand-dependent interaction with chromatin is likely shared by all steroid hormone receptors regardless of their capacity to repress transcription in the absence of ligand.',\n",

In liver fibrogenesis, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are thought to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, but the origins of both HSCs and myofibroblasts remain elusive. In the developing liver, lung, and intestine, mesothelial cells (MCs) differentiate into specific mesenchymal cell types; however, the contribution of this differentiation to organ injury is unknown. In the present study, using mouse models, conditional cell lineage analysis has demonstrated that MCs expressing Wilms tumor 1 give rise to HSCs and myofibroblasts during liver fibrogenesis. Primary MCs, isolated from adult mouse liver using antibodies against glycoprotein M6a, undergo myofibroblastic transdifferentiation. Antagonism of TGF-Î² signaling suppresses transition of MCs to mesenchymal cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that MCs undergo mesothelial-mesenchymal transition and participate in liver injury via differentiation to HSCs and myofibroblasts.',\n",

Here, we show that hepatic Bmal1, a core transcription activator of the molecular clock, is post-transcriptionally regulated by signals from insulin, an important hormone that is temporally controlled by feeding. Insulin promotes postprandial Akt-mediated Ser42-phosphorylation of Bmal1 to induce its dissociation from DNA, interaction with 14-3-3 protein and subsequently nuclear exclusion, which results in the suppression of Bmal1 transcriptional activity. Inverted feeding cycles not only shift the phase of daily insulin oscillation, but also elevate the amplitude due to food overconsumption. This enhanced and reversed insulin signalling initiates the reset of clock gene rhythms by altering Bmal1 nuclear accumulation in mouse liver. These results reveal the molecular mechanism of insulin signalling in regulating peripheral circadian rhythms.',\n",

An ammonium sulfate precipitate of mouse liver cytosol was purified by five chromatographic steps to isolate CBP in 14% yield and &gt; 99% purity as monitored by [3H]cantharidin-binding activity. The purification factor of 2230-fold corresponds to a CBP content of 0.045% of the liver cytosolic protein. CBP is a heterodimer consisting of a 61-kDa alpha subunit and a 39-kDa beta subunit. Amino acid sequences of four peptides from CBP-alpha and three peptides from CBP-beta are identical with deduced amino acid sequences for the A alpha regulatory and C beta catalytic subunits, respectively, of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This assignment of CBP as PP2A-AC from structural evidence is supported by biochemical studies with selective substrates and inhibitors. CBP dephosphorylation of phosphorylase alpha is sensitive not only to okadaic acid, as with PP2A, but also to cantharidin and its analogs, consistent with their potency in blocking the radioligand binding site of CBP. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of [3H]cantharidin binding to CBP. PP2A is present in many mammalian tissues and in plants and is involved in regulatory phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events which modulate multiple cellular functions. Inhibition of PP2A activity may account for the diverse effects and toxicity of cantharidin and its analogs, including the herbicide endothall, in mammals and possibly plants.',\n",

Similar acute phase reactant induction was observed in mouse liver upon IL-TIF injection, and IL-TIF expression was found to be rapidly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, suggesting that this cytokine contributes to the inflammatory response in vivo.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Two mouse growth hormone-receptor primary translation products of Mr 95,900 and 31,800 were identified from in vitro-translated late pregnant mouse liver mRNA. RNA isolated from mouse liver was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system containing [35S]methionine, and the growth hormone receptor primary translation products were identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-mouse growth hormone receptor antiserum followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/PAGE and fluorography. Detectable amounts of the Mr 95,900 and 31,800 proteins were not present in in vitro-translated nonpregnant mouse liver mRNA. This result is consistent with previous observations of the up-regulation of growth hormone receptors in the liver during pregnancy in the mouse. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of mouse liver and adipose tissue RNA with a rabbit growth hormone receptor cDNA probe revealed two hybridizing mRNAs of approximately 3.9 and 1.2 kilobases. These two RNAs were greatly up-regulated in liver, but not in adipose tissue, during pregnancy. The sizes of these mRNAs closely matched predictions of the sizes of the mRNAs coding for the proteins of Mr 95,900 and 31,800 made by in vitro translation of size-fractionated late-pregnant mouse liver poly(A)+RNA. These results suggest a mechanism for the generation of both the heterogeneous forms of the growth hormone receptor identified in mouse liver membrane preparations and the mouse serum growth hormone-binding protein.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Significant numbers of chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic in mouse liver although they do not exhibit carcinogenic activity in other organs or tissues of mice or rats. This review focuses on the reasons for the unique susceptibility of the mouse liver to these carcinogens and the extent to which the carcinogenic activity of a chemical in mouse liver can be used to predict carcinogenicity in humans. Many of these mouse liver carcinogens lack genotoxic activity and, as such, have been proposed to be tumor promoters. Two mechanisms that may explain the action of nongenotoxic carcinogens in mouse liver are reviewed. These are: (1) direct action on precursor cancer cells, either to accelerate their growth or to prevent their death and (2) the selective growth advantage, resulting from regenerative hyperplasia of precursor cancer cells in response to the necrosis of normal cells produced by hepatotoxins. Estimating human health risks on the basis of mouse liver tumor data is believed to differ for nongenotoxic and genotoxic carcinogens in two fundamental ways. The first involves intraspecies extrapolation and the second involves low-dose extrapolation. In conclusion, although mouse liver tumor data are seen to be of value in estimating human health hazard, it is important to distinguish between genotoxic and nongenotoxic mechanisms in applying such data. Further study of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of chemical carcinogens is necessary to determine the relationship between their activity in mouse liver and their activity in humans.',\n",

We show that although short-term loss of Î²1-integrin has no obvious consequences for normal livers, partial hepatectomy leads to severe liver necrosis and reduced hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, loss of Î²1-integrin in hepatocytes impairs ligand-induced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor receptors, thereby attenuating downstream receptor signalling in vitro and in vivo.

Transcripts of the two zinc transporter gene families (ZnT and Zip) were screened for regulation in mouse liver after turpentine-induced inflammation and LPS administration. Zip14 mRNA was the transporter transcript most up-regulated by inflammation and LPS. IL-6 knockout (IL-6<SUP>-/-</SUP>) mice did not exhibit either hypozincemia or the induction of Zip14 with turpentine inflammation. However, in IL-6<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice, LPS produced a milder hypozincemic response but no Zip14 induction. Northern analysis showed Zip14 up-regulation was specific for the liver, with one major transcript. Immunohistochemistry, using an antibody to an extracellular Zip14 epitope, showed both LPS and turpentine increased abundance of Zip14 at the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. IL-6 produced increased expression of Zip14 in primary hepatocytes cultures and localization of the protein to the plasma membrane. Transfection of mZip14 cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells increased zinc uptake as measured by both a fluorescent probe for free Zn<SUP>2+</SUP> and <SUP>65</SUP>Zn accumulation, as well as by metallothionein mRNA induction, all indicating that Zip14 functions as a zinc importer. Zip14 was localized in plasma membrane of the transfected cells.

Surprisingly, we found widespread insulin mRNA and protein expression in different diabetic mouse and rat models, including streptozotocin-treated mice and rats, ob/ob mice, and mice fed high-fat diets. We detected in diabetic mice proinsulin- and insulin-positive cells in the liver, adipose tissue, spleen, bone marrow, and thymus; many cells also produced glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. By in situ nucleic acid hybridization, diabetic, but not nondiabetic, mouse liver exhibited insulin transcript-positive cells, indicating that insulin was synthesized by these cells. In transgenic mice that express GFP driven by the mouse insulin promoter, streptozotocin-induced diabetes led to the appearance of GFP-positive cells in liver, adipose tissue, and bone marrow; the fluorescent signals showed complete concordance with the presence of immunoreactive proinsulin. Hyperglycemia produced by glucose injections in nondiabetic mice led to the appearance of proinsulin- and insulin-positive cells within 3 days. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that most of the extrapancreatic proinsulin-producing cells originated from the bone marrow. Immunoreactive proinsulin- and insulin-positive cells were also detected in the liver, adipose tissue, and bone marrow of diabetic rats, indicating that extrapancreatic, extrathymic insulin production occurs in more than one species. These observations have implications for the regulation of insulin gene expression, modulation of self-tolerance by insulin gene expression, and strategies for the generation of insulin-producing cells for the treatment of diabetes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components by autophagy is essential for cellular survival and homeostasis under nutrient-deprived conditions. Acute regulation of autophagy by nutrient-sensing kinases is well defined, but longer-term transcriptional regulation is relatively unknown. Here we show that the fed-state sensing nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the fasting transcriptional activator cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) coordinately regulate the hepatic autophagy gene network. Pharmacological activation of FXR repressed many autophagy genes and inhibited autophagy even in fasted mice, and feeding-mediated inhibition of macroautophagy was attenuated in FXR-knockout mice. From mouse liver chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing data, FXR and CREB binding peaks were detected at 178 and 112 genes, respectively, out of 230 autophagy-related genes, and 78 genes showed shared binding, mostly in their promoter regions. CREB promoted autophagic degradation of lipids, or lipophagy, under nutrient-deprived conditions, and FXR inhibited this response. Mechanistically, CREB upregulated autophagy genes, including Atg7, Ulk1 and Tfeb, by recruiting the coactivator CRTC2. After feeding or pharmacological activation, FXR trans-repressed these genes by disrupting the functional CREB-CRTC2 complex. This study identifies the new FXR-CREB axis as a key physiological switch regulating autophagy, resulting in sustained nutrient regulation of autophagy during feeding/fasting cycles.',\n",

Using hybridization of globin cDNA to globin mRNA as a model system, we found that equivalent amounts of cDNA were required both for the saturation of the mRNA hybridization and for complete inhibition of globin synthesis. Also, the rate of inactivation of translation was identical to the rate of hybridization and followed the predicted kinetic form. This assay has been applied to the analysis of a set of abundant mRNAs in mouse liver. Hybridization of liver mRNA with total liver cDNA in slight excess to a low C<SUB>0</SUB>t value specifically inhibited translation of several major polypeptides. Melting of the hybrids prior to translation restored synthesis of these polypeptides. Moreover, we found that different liver mRNAs are inactivated with different kinetics; the results suggest that the mRNAs for the major urinary polypeptide and for albumin are the most abundant and second most abundant, respectively, in mouse liver. The general applications of this technique are discussed.',\n",

Gluconeogenesis is strongly stimulated during fasting and is aberrantly activated in diabetes mellitus. Here we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is strongly induced in liver in fasting mice and in three mouse models of insulin action deficiency: streptozotocin-induced diabetes, ob/ob genotype and liver insulin-receptor knockout. PGC-1 is induced synergistically in primary liver cultures by cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids. Adenoviral-mediated expression of PGC-1 in hepatocytes in culture or in vivo strongly activates an entire programme of key gluconeogenic enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase, leading to increased glucose output. Full transcriptional activation of the PEPCK promoter requires coactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor and the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-4Î± (hepatic nuclear factor-4Î±) by PGC-1. These results implicate PGC-1 as a key modulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis and as a central target of the insulin-cAMP axis in liver.',\n",

Combining detailed expression analyses with gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identify epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2) as a conserved regulatory factor that controls the neonatal-to-adult switch of ~20% of splice isoforms in mouse and human hepatocytes. The normal shift in splicing coincides tightly with dramatic postnatal induction of ESRP2 in hepatocytes. We further demonstrate that forced expression of ESRP2 in immature mouse and human hepatocytes is sufficient to drive a reciprocal shift in splicing and causes various physiological abnormalities. These findings define a direct role for ESRP2 in the generation of conserved repertoires of adult splice isoforms that facilitate terminal differentiation and maturation of hepatocytes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A method for determining concentration of metallothionein (MT) isoforms in mouse liver was established by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), and carbonic anhydrase was used as an internal standard. The cytosol fraction was heated at 100Â°C for 1 min, and the supernatant was applied directly to CZE after filtration. Both MT-1 and MT-2 isoforms were identified from the migration times of purified MT isoforms, and the peaks were definitely identified from the other peaks. In addition, carbonic anhydrase was adopted as an internal standard. Based on standard curves of purified MT isoforms, concentrations of MT isoforms in the liver were determined from the estimates of peak areas. In control mouse liver, MT-1 isoform was detected at 48.5Â±25.4 Î¼g/g wet weight, and MT-2 isoform was 154.0Â±39.7 Î¼g/g. Twenty-four hours after zinc injection, MT-1 increased to 773.7Â±374.3 Î¼g/g, and MT-2 was 487.2Â±207.1 Î¼g/g. The addition of ascorbic acid to the homogenizing medium resulted in the decrease of MT isoforms in mouse liver. From these findings, we concluded that CZE analysis using a polyacrylamide-coated tube at neutral pH makes quantitation of MT isoforms in mouse liver possible.',\n",

We identified several altered biological processes and pathways, like fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis, which explain the observed phenotype of this mouse.

We found that exposure to the cyanobacterial extract (CE) resulted in increase in liver weight/body weight ratio in a dose-dependent manner, and the mouse liver reached the maximum size at 1 h post-exposure (pe). SOD activity in mouse liver decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and time course study indicated that it decreased significantly at 1 and 2 h pe, and resumed at 3 h pe as compared to control. CE caused LDH activity in the livers of mice to decrease in a dose- and time-dependent manner except a small increase in 30 min pe mice. GSH-Px activity increased in a dose-dependent manner, and was higher than that in the control over the 3 h observation period. The present findings suggest that oxidative damage may be involved in the toxicity of microcystins on mouse.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ultrasound imaging is a well-established clinical imaging technique providing real-time, quantitative anatomical and physiological information in humans. The lack of ionising radiation and relative low purchase and maintenance costs results in it being one of the most frequently used clinical imaging techniques with increasing use for guiding interventional clinical procedures. Until 20 years ago, translation of clinical ultrasound practices to preclinical applications proved a significant technological challenge due to the smaller size (25g vs 70kg) and rapid conscious heart-rate (500-700bpm vs 60bpm) of the mouse requiring an increase in both spatial and temporal resolution of 10-20 fold in order to achieve diagnostic information comparable to that achieved clinically. Since 2000 (Foster et al 2000), these technological challenges have been overcome and commercial high frequency ultrasound scanners have enabled longitudinal studies of disease progression in small animal models to be undertaken. Adult, neonatal and embryonic rats, mice and zebrafish can now be scanned with resolutions down to 30 microns and with sufficient temporal resolution to enable cardiac abnormalities in all these species to be identified. In mice and rats, quantification of blood flow in cardiac chambers, renal, liver and uterine vessels and intra-mural tissue movements can be measured using the Doppler technique. Ultrasonic contrast microbubbles used routinely for clinical applications are now being further developed to include targeting mechanisms and drug-loading capabilities and the results in animal models bode well for translation for targeted drug delivery in humans.',\n",

Pancreatic cancers is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States with less than 2% of the patients surviving for 5 yr. In an effort to help develop more effective treatment modalities for pancreatic cancer and improve detection, we report an animal model for individual human pancreatic-cancer patients. The model involves orthotopic transplantation of histologically intact pancreatic-cancer specimens to the nude-mouse pancreas, which can result in models that resemble the clinical picture including (i) extensive local tumor growth, (ii) extension of the locally growing human pancreatic cancer to the nude-mouse stomach and duodenum, (iii) metastases of the human pancreatic tumor to the nude-mouse liver and regional lymph nodes, and (iv) distant metastases of the human pancreatic tumor to the nude-mouse adrenal gland, diaphragm, and mediastinal lymph nodes. In a series of five patient cases, a 100% take rate has been demonstrated, and of 17 mice transplanted, 15 supported tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of the antigenic phenotype of the transplanted human pancreatic tumors showed a similar pattern of expression of two different human tumor-associated antigens, such as tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 and carcinoembryonic antigen in the transplanted tumors when compared with the original surgical biopsy, suggesting similarity between the two. This model should, therefore, prove valuable for treatment evaluation of individual cancer patients, as well as for evaluation of experimental treatment modalities for this disease.',\n",

About 10 percent of the mouse single-copy sequences are transcribed in mouse brain tissue. Estimates of about 3 percent were obtained for mouse liver and kidney RNA's. If only one of the complementary DNA strands is transcribed, this hybridization value implies that the equivalent of at least 300,000 different sequences of 1000 nucleotides are expressed in mouse brain tissue.

We show that tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche.

Following purification of the membrane fraction, SDS-PAGE was carried out as a useful separation step. After staining, gels with protein bands were cut, reduced, alkylated and trypsin-digested. The peptide mixtures extracted from each gel slice were fractionated by two-dimensional nano liquid chromatography (2DnanoLC) coupled online with tandem mass spectrometry analysis (NanoESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS). The proteins were identified by MASCOT search against a mouse protein database using a peptide and fragment mass tolerance of Â±0.5\\u2009Da. Protein identification was carried out using a Mowse scoring algorithm with a confidence level of 95% and processed by MSQuant v1.5 software for further validation. In total, 318 verified membrane proteins from mouse liver tissues were identified; 66.67% of them (212 proteins) contained at least one or more transmembrane domains predicted by the SOSUI program and 43 were found to be unique microsome membranes. Furthermore, GRAVY values of membrane proteins varied in the range -1.1276 to 0.9016 and only 31 (9.76%) membrane proteins had positive values. The functions and subcellular locations of the identified proteins were categorized as well, according to universal GO annotations.',\n",

However, the mechanism of sexually dimorphic expression is still not fully understood. In this study, a pCAG-eGFP transgenic mouse strain with a specific transgene integration site in the Akr1A1 locus presented male-biased EGFP expression in the liver, and the expression was activated by testosterone during puberty. The integration of the pCAG-eGFP transgene altered the epigenetic regulation of the adjacent chromatin, including increased binding of STAT5b, a sexually dimorphic expression regulator, and the transformation of DNA methylation from hypermethylation into male-biased hypomethylation. Through this de novo sexually dimorphic expression of the transgene, the Akr1A1<SUP>eGFP</SUP> mouse provides a useful model to study the mechanisms and the dynamic changes of sexually dimorphic gene expression during either development or pathogenesis of the liver.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Sexual dimorphism in gene regulation, including DNA methylation, is the main driver of sexual dimorphism in phenotypes. However, the questions of how and when sex shapes DNA methylation remain unresolved. Recently, using mice with different combinations of genetic and phenotypic sex, we identified sex-associated differentially methylated regions (sDMRs) that depended on the sex phenotype. Focusing on a panel of validated sex-phenotype dependent male- and female-biased sDMRs, we tested the developmental dynamics of sex bias in liver methylation and the impacts of mutations in the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, or the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 gene. True hermaphrodites that carry both unilateral ovaries and contralateral testes were also tested. Our data show that sex bias in methylation either coincides with or follows sex bias in the expression of sDMR-proximal genes, suggesting that sex bias in gene expression may be required for demethylation at certain sDMRs. Global ablation of AR, ESR1, or a liver-specific loss of BCL6, all alter sDMR methylation, whereas presence of both an ovary and a testis delays the establishment of male-type methylation levels in hermaphrodites. Moreover, the Bcl6-LKO shows dissociation between expression and methylation, suggesting a distinct role of BCL6 in demethylation of intragenic sDMRs.',\n",

As the results, both 20- and 120-nm ZnO belong to non-toxic chemicals according to the Globally Harmonized Classification System (GHS) for the classification of chemicals. The distribution determination showed that Zn was mainly retained in the bone, kidney and pancreas after 20- and 120-nm ZnO administration. However, the results of blood measurement suggest that the increase in blood viscosity could be induced by low and median dose of 20-nm ZnO but high dose of 120-nm ZnO. The pathological examination showed that the 120-nm ZnO treated mice had dose-effect pathological damages in stomach, liver, heart and spleen, whereas, 20-nm ZnO displayed negative dose-effect damages in liver, spleen and pancreas. Therefore, we conclude that the liver, spleen, heart, pancreas and bone are the target organs for 20- and 120-nm ZnO oral exposure. More attention should be paid on the potential toxicity induced by low dose of 20-nm ZnO oral exposure.',\n",

Although innovative treatments such as gene therapy or bispecific antibody therapy have been introduced, substantial unmet needs still exist with respect to achieving long-lasting therapeutic effects and treatment options for inhibitor patients. Antithrombin (AT), an endogenous negative regulator of thrombin generation, is a potent genome editing target for sustainable treatment of patients with hemophilia A and B. In this study, we developed and optimized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver Cas9 mRNA along with single guide RNA that targeted AT in the mouse liver. The LNP-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 delivery resulted in the inhibition of AT that led to improvement in thrombin generation. Bleeding-associated phenotypes were recovered in both hemophilia A and B mice. No active off-targets, liver-induced toxicity, and substantial anti-Cas9 immune responses were detected, indicating that the LNP-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 delivery was a safe and efficient approach for hemophilia therapy.We showed that lipid nanoparticleâpacked CRISPR- mediated antithrombin gene editing offers a sustainable and safe hemophilia therapy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'S-nitrosylation, the selective posttranslational modification of protein cysteine residues to form S-nitrosocysteine, is one of the molecular mechanisms by which nitric oxide influences diverse biological functions. In this study, unique MS-based proteomic approaches precisely pinpointed the site of S-nitrosylation in 328 peptides in 192 proteins endogenously modified in WT mouse liver. Structural analyses revealed that S-nitrosylated cysteine residues were equally distributed in hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas of proteins with an average predicted pK<SUB>a</SUB> of 10.01 Â± 2.1. S-nitrosylation sites were over-represented in Î±-helices and under-represented in coils as compared with unmodified cysteine residues in the same proteins (Ï<SUP>2</SUP> test, P &lt; 0.02). A quantile-quantile probability plot indicated that the distribution of S-nitrosocysteine residues was skewed toward larger surface accessible areas compared with the unmodified cysteine residues in the same proteins. Seventy percent of the S-nitrosylated cysteine residues were surrounded by negatively or positively charged amino acids within a 6-Ã distance. The location of cysteine residues in Î±-helices and coils in highly accessible surfaces bordered by charged amino acids implies site directed S-nitrosylation mediated by protein-protein or small molecule interactions. Moreover, 13 modified cysteine residues were coordinated with metals and 15 metalloproteins were endogenously modified supporting metal-catalyzed S-nitrosylation mechanisms. Collectively, the endogenous S-nitrosoproteome in the liver has structural features that accommodate multiple mechanisms for selective site-directed S-nitrosylation.',\n",

It is also the active ingredient of wormwood oil and some other herbal medicines and is reported to have antinociceptive, insecticidal, and anthelmintic activity. This study elucidates the mechanism of Î±-thujone neurotoxicity and identifies its major metabolites and their role in the poisoning process. Four observations establish that Î±-thujone is a modulator of the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor. First, the poisoning signs (and their alleviation by diazepam and phenobarbital) in mice are similar to those of the classical antagonist picrotoxinin. Second, a strain of Drosophila specifically resistant to chloride channel blockers is also tolerant to Î±-thujone. Third, Î±-thujone is a competitive inhibitor of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate binding to mouse brain membranes. Most definitively, GABA-induced peak currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons are suppressed by Î±-thujone with complete reversal after washout. Î±-Thujone is quickly metabolized in vitro by mouse liver microsomes with NADPH (cytochrome P450) forming 7-hydroxy-Î±-thujone as the major product plus five minor ones (4-hydroxy-Î±-thujone, 4-hydroxy-Î²-thujone, two other hydroxythujones, and 7,8-dehydro-Î±-thujone), several of which also are detected in the brain of mice treated i.p. with Î±-thujone. The major 7-hydroxy metabolite attains much higher brain levels than Î±-thujone but is less toxic to mice and Drosophila and less potent in the binding assay. The other metabolites assayed are also detoxification products. Thus, Î±-thujone in absinthe and herbal medicines is a rapid-acting and readily detoxified modulator of the GABA-gated chloride channel.',\n",

Here we reveal that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved into a mutated DNA base pair within a single cell cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate, unrepaired, into daughter cells for multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent mutations. We characterize this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can produce multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby generating both multiallelic and combinatorial genetic diversity. The phasing of lesions enables accurate measurement of strand-biased repair processes, quantification of oncogenic selection and fine mapping of sister-chromatid-exchange events. Finally, we demonstrate that lesion segregation is a unifying property of exogenous mutagens, including UV light and chemotherapy agents in human cells and tumours, which has profound implications for the evolution and adaptation of cancer genomes.',\n",

The partitioning of certain translation products between the two fractions suggests that the physical contamination of the free mRNA by the ER is 10%, and contamination of the ER by the free is 1%. Reassociation crossreactions suggest that no sequences are totally absent from either fraction. In particular, the rare sequences are shared between the two fractions. Among the more abundant sequences, we detect three groups: (i) a group of about 10 sequences that are relatively abundant in both fractions; (ii) a group that occurs mostly in the free fraction; (iii) a group of about 12 sequences, 6 or 7 of them encoding secretory polypeptides. The members of this group are largely or entirely confined to the ER fraction. Secretory proteins are almost entirely absent from the products of th free mRNA fraction. Quantitation of individual mRNA sequences by hybridization with cDNA clones shows that a range of sequence concentrations exists within the abundant class of ER mRNA.',\n",

The effects of these compounds on drug-metabolizing enzymes have not been characterized and their potential pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs are therefore unknown. The present study investigated whether treatment with MA (300 mg Sb5+/kg body weight/day, subcutaneously) for 24 days affected the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A (ethoxyresorufin- O-deethylase), CYP2A5 (coumarin 7-hydroxylase), CYP2E1 ( p-nitrophenol-hydroxylase), CYP2B9/10 (benzyloxy-resorufin- O-debenzylase), or CYP3A11 (erythromycin- N-demethylase) in the livers of Swiss Webster (SW) and DBA-2 male and female mice. The results showed that CYP2A5-, CYP2E1-, and CYP3A11-catalyzed reactions were unaffected by MA treatment. A decrease in CYP2B9/10 activity was noted in DBA-2 females (but not males) and was not observed in SW males or females. However, repeated MA administration reduced mouse liver CYP1A activity. CYP1A2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were not affected by MA and in vitro exposure of mouse liver microsomes to Sb3+ and Sb5+ did not reduce CYP1A activity. These findings suggested that in vivo treatment with Sb5+ drugs depressed CYP1A activity, without downregulating CYP1A2 mRNA expression. Since in vitro treatment of liver microsomes failed to inhibit CYP1A activity, this effect may require intact cells.',\n",

Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy offers a three-dimensional, real-time imaging capability with chemical specificity. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between several constituents in tissues because their spectral characteristics can overlap. Furthermore, imaging speeds in previous multispectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging techniques were limited. Here, we demonstrate label-free imaging of tissues by 30 frames/s stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with frame-by-frame wavelength tunability. To produce multicolour images showing different constituents, spectral images were processed by modified independent component analysis, which can extract small differences in spectral features. We present various imaging modalities such as two-dimensional spectral imaging of rat liver, two-colour three-dimensional imaging of a vessel in rat liver, spectral imaging of several sections of intestinal villi in mouse, and in vivo spectral imaging of mouse ear skin.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Reversible and sub-lethal stresses to the mitochondria elicit a program of compensatory responses that ultimately improve mitochondrial function, a conserved anti-aging mechanism termed mitohormesis. Here, we show that harmol, a member of the beta-carbolines family with anti-depressant properties, improves mitochondrial function and metabolic parameters, and extends healthspan. Treatment with harmol induces a transient mitochondrial depolarization, a strong mitophagy response, and the AMPK compensatory pathway both in cultured C2C12 myotubes and in male mouse liver, brown adipose tissue and muscle, even though harmol crosses poorly the blood-brain barrier. Mechanistically, simultaneous modulation of the targets of harmol monoamine-oxidase B and GABA-A receptor reproduces harmol-induced mitochondrial improvements. Diet-induced pre-diabetic male mice improve their glucose tolerance, liver steatosis and insulin sensitivity after treatment with harmol. Harmol or a combination of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor modulators extend the lifespan of hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans or female Drosophila melanogaster. Finally, two-year-old male and female mice treated with harmol exhibit delayed frailty onset with improved glycemia, exercise performance and strength. Our results reveal that peripheral targeting of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor, common antidepressant targets, extends healthspan through mitohormesis.',\n",

Herein we address the spatiotemporal role of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in the development of zonation in embryonic mouse liver by conditional deletion of Apc and Î²-catenin at different stages of mouse liver development. In normal development, the ammonia metabolising enzymes carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPSI) and Glutamine synthetase (GS) begin to be expressed in separate hepatoblasts from E13.5 and E15.5 respectively and gradually increase in number thereafter. Restriction of GS expression occurs at E18 and becomes increasingly limited to the terminal perivenous hepatocytes postnatally. Expression of nuclear Î²-catenin coincides with the restriction of GS expression to the terminal perivenous hepatocytes. Conditional loss of Apc resulted in the expression of nuclear Î²-catenin throughout the developing liver and increased number of cells expressing GS. Conversely, conditional loss of Î²-catenin resulted in loss of GS expression. These data suggest that the Wnt pathway is critical to the development of zonation as well as maintaining the zonation in the adult liver.',\n",

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a highly representative chemokine, is critical in liver disease pathogenesis. We investigated the role of MIF in regulating hepatocytic MCP-1 expression. MIF and MCP-1 expression were characterized by immunochemistry, RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunoblotting in CCl<SUB>4</SUB>-treated mouse liver and isolated hepatocytes. MIF was primarily distributed in hepatocytes, and its expression increased upon acute liver injury. Its expression was also increased in injured hepatocytes, induced by LPS or CCl<SUB>4</SUB>, which mimic liver injury in vitro. MIF was expressed earlier than MCP-1, strongly inducing hepatocytic MCP-1 expression. Moreover, the increase in MCP-1 expression induced by MIF was inhibited by CD74- or CD44-specific siRNAs and SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Further, CD74 or CD44 deficiency effectively inhibited MIF-induced p38 activation. MIF inhibitor ISO-1 reduced MCP-1 expression and p38 phosphorylation in CCl<SUB>4</SUB>-treated mouse liver. Our results showed that MIF regulates MCP-1 expression in hepatocytes of injured liver via CD74, CD44, and p38 MAPK in an autocrine manner, providing compelling information on the role of MIF in liver injury, and implying a new regulatory mechanism for liver inflammation.',\n",

Platelets are major carriers of serotonin in the blood. In thrombocytopenic mice, a serotonin agonist reconstituted liver proliferation. The expression of 5-HT2A and 2B subtype serotonin receptors in the liver increased after hepatectomy. Antagonists of 5-HT2A and 2B receptors inhibited liver regeneration. Liver regeneration was also blunted in mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin. This failure of regeneration was rescued by reloading serotonin-free platelets with a serotonin precursor molecule.

       "    'abstract': 'We propose an offset-sparsity decomposition method for the enhancement of a color microscopic image of a stained specimen. The method decomposes vectorized spectral images into offset terms and sparse terms. A sparse term represents an enhanced image, and an offset term represents a \"shadow.\" The related optimization problem is solved by computational improvement of the accelerated proximal gradient method used initially to solve the related rank-sparsity decomposition problem. Removal of an image-adapted color offset yields an enhanced image with improved colorimetric differences among the histological structures. This is verified by a no-reference colorfulness measure estimated from 35 specimens of the human liver, 1 specimen of the mouse liver stained with hematoxylin and eosin, 6 specimens of the mouse liver stained with Sudan III, and 3 specimens of the human liver stained with the anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody. The colorimetric difference improves on average by 43.86% with a 99% confidence interval (CI) of [35.35%, 51.62%]. Furthermore, according to the mean opinion score, estimated on the basis of the evaluations of five pathologists, images enhanced by the proposed method exhibit an average quality improvement of 16.60% with a 99% CI of [10.46%, 22.73%].',\n",

Restriction enzyme analyses reveal that the cloned molecule contains a copy of one of the GR endogenous MMTV proviruses flanked on both sides by 2--3 kb of mouse genomic DNA. In this report we have examined the expression of the cloned MMTV provirus after cotransfection with the herpes thymidine kinase (TK; ATP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase,, EC 2.7.1.21) gene and integration into mouse LTK- cells. Nine individual TK+ transformants were selected, and all were found to contain MMTV-transfected DNA. One of the TK+ transformants was chosen for further study. Total poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from the cells, and liquid hybridization analyses with MMTV cDNA showed that it contained 0.02% MMTV-specific RNA. The sizes of the MMTV-specific species were determined and found to correspond to the 35S and 24S mRNAs synthesized in MMTV-infected cells. Glucocorticoid hormones have been shown to increase the concentration of MMTV RNA in virus-infected cultured cells. Therefore, we tested the effect of dexamethasone on the concentration of MMTV-specific RNA in cells transfected with the MMTV proviral DNA. The amount of MMTV-specific poly(A)-containing RNA found in the cells grown in the presence of hormone was 0.17%. Therefore, dexamethasone causes an 8-fold increase in the amount of MMTV-specific RNA in mouse cells containing several copies of a cloned and transfected MMTV proviral gene.\",\n",

The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD-LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic Î²-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.',\n",

These signals have been identified and studied in multiple organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung, heart, bone, bone marrow, central nervous system, retina and some cancers<SUP>1-4</SUP>. Here we use the developing liver as a model organ to study angiocrine signals<SUP>5,6</SUP>, and show that the growth rate of the liver correlates both spatially and temporally with blood perfusion to this organ. By manipulating blood flow through the liver vasculature, we demonstrate that vessel perfusion activates Î²1 integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). Notably, both Î²1 integrin and VEGFR3 are strictly required for normal production of hepatocyte growth factor, survival of hepatocytes and liver growth. Ex vivo perfusion of adult mouse liver and in vitro mechanical stretching of human hepatic endothelial cells illustrate that mechanotransduction alone is sufficient to turn on angiocrine signals. When the endothelial cells are mechanically stretched, angiocrine signals trigger in vitro proliferation and survival of primary human hepatocytes. Our findings uncover a signalling pathway in vascular endothelial cells that translates blood perfusion and mechanotransduction into organ growth and maintenance.',\n",

HCV core protein is not only a component of viral particles but also a multifunctional protein because liver steatosis and HCC are developed in HCV core gene-transgenic (CoreTg) mice. Proteasome activator PA28Î³/REGÎ³ regulates host and viral proteins such as nuclear hormone receptors and HCV core protein. Here we show that a knockout of the PA28Î³ gene induces the accumulation of HCV core protein in the nucleus of hepatocytes of CoreTg mice and disrupts development of both hepatic steatosis and HCC. Furthermore, the genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis and srebp-1c promoter activity were up-regulated by HCV core protein in the cell line and the mouse liver in a PA28Î³-dependent manner. Heterodimer composed of liver X receptor Î± (LXRÎ±) and retinoid X receptor Î± (RXRÎ±) is known to up-regulate srebp-1c promoter activity. Our data also show that HCV core protein enhances the binding of LXRÎ±/RXRÎ± to LXR-response element in the presence but not the absence of PA28Î³.

Na<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1), encoded by the Slc9a3r1 gene, functions as a scaffold protein, which is implicated in the regulation of membrane expression of various cell-surface proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock component PERIOD2 (PER2) modulates transcription of the mouse Slc9a3r1 gene, generating diurnal accumulation of NHERF1 in the mouse liver. Basal expression of Slc9a3r1 was dependent on transcriptional activation by p65/p50. PER2 bound to p65 protein and prevented p65/p50-mediated transactivation of Slc9a3r1. The time-dependent interaction between PER2 and p65 underlay diurnal oscillation in the hepatic expression of Slc9a3r1/NHERF1. The results of immunoprecipitation experiments and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of mouse liver revealed that NHERF1 time-dependently interacted with fatty acid transport protein-5 (FATP5). Temporary accumulation of NHERF1 protein stabilized plasmalemmal localization of FATP5, thereby enhancing hepatic uptake of fatty acids at certain times of the day. Our results suggest an unacknowledged role for PER2 in regulating the diurnal expression of NHERF1 in mouse liver. This machinery also contributed to diurnal changes in the ability of hepatic cells to uptake fatty acids.',\n",

Ageing leads to functional impairment of the liver and predisposes the liver to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mapping the molecular changes of the liver with ageing may help to understand the crosstalk of ageing with different liver diseases. A systems-level analysis of the ageing-induced liver changes and its crosstalk with liver-associated conditions is lacking. In the present study, we performed network-level analyses of the ageing liver using mouse transcriptomic data and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A sample-wise analysis using network entropy measure was performed, which showed an increasing trend with ageing and helped to identify ageing genes based on local entropy changes. To gain further insights, we also integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between young and different age groups with the PPI network and identified core modules and nodes associated with ageing. Finally, we computed the network proximity of the ageing network with different networks of liver diseases and regeneration to quantify the effect of ageing. Our analysis revealed the complex interplay of immune, cancer signalling, and metabolic genes in the ageing liver. We found significant network proximities between ageing and NAFLD, HCC, liver damage conditions, and the early phase of liver regeneration with common nodes including NLRP12, TRP53, GSK3B, CTNNB1, MAT1 and FASN. Overall, our study maps the network-level changes of ageing and their interconnections with the physiology and pathology of the liver.',\n",

Since liquid nitrogen is used as the cryogens, it is difficult to control the freezing rate and thawing rate. In hyperthermia, there are problems of thermotolerance acquisition by heat shock protein (HSP) and only a few studies regarding hyperthermia with cryosurgery have been investigated. The aims of this study are to produce cryosurgery-hyperthermia system utilizing Stirling Cooler and Peltier device and evaluate hyperthermia after cryosurgery by comparing cryosurgery and hyperthermia on the mouse liver. Normal living liver tissues of mice are divided into 3 groups (cryosurgery and cryosurgery-hyperthermia, hyperthermia), then performed cryosurgery, hyperthermia and hyperthermia followed cryosurgery, applying a 1 cycle rapid freezing and slow thawing method for cryosurgery. The temperatures of the tissue surface and probe were measured during operation, the liver was stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) after operation and observed under an optical microscope. The results showed measured temperature of rapid freezing and slow thawing. HE stained tissue showed stasis, pyknosis, nucleus disappearance and decreasing stainability in cryosurgery and cryosurgery-hyperthermia group, stasis, pyknosis and degreasing stainability in hyperthermia group. The results suggested cryosurgery-hyperthermia was the most effective to destroy the tissue.',\n",

Recent evidence suggests that these effects, however, do not necessarily occur when c-Myc is overexpressed in primary mammalian cells. We sought to determine the immediate effects of transient overexpression of c-Myc in primary cells in vivo by using recombinant adenovirus to overexpress human MYC in mouse liver. Mice were intravenously injected with adenoviruses encoding MYC (Ad/Myc), E2F-1 (Ad/E2F-1), or Î²-galactosidase (Ad/LacZ). Transgene expression was detectable 4 days after injection. Expression of ectopic c-Myc was immediately accompanied by enlarged and dysmorphic hepatocytes in the absence of significant cell proliferation or apoptosis. These findings were not present in the livers of mice injected with Ad/E2F-1 or Ad/LacZ. Prominent hepatocyte nuclei and nucleoli were associated with the up-regulation of large- and small-subunit ribosomal and nucleolar genes, suggesting that c-Myc may induce their expression to increase cell mass. Our studies support a role for c-Myc in the in vivo control of vertebrate cell size and metabolism independent of cell proliferation.',\n",

The woodchuck hepatocytes were transplanted via intrasplenic injection and were found to integrate into the recipient mouse liver cord structure. Normal adult woodchuck hepatocytes proliferated and reconstituted up to 90% of the uPA/RAG-2 mouse liver. uPA/RAG-2 mice containing woodchuck hepatocytes were infectable with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and showed WHV replication for at least 10 months with titers up to 1 Ã 10<SUP>11</SUP> virions per ml in the peripheral blood. WHV-infected hepatocytes from chronic carrier woodchucks also established a persistent infection in uPA/RAG-2 mice after an 8- to 12-week lag period of viremia. Although WHV envelope, core, and X proteins were produced in the uPA/RAG-2 mice, no inflammatory host immune response was observed in the liver of WHV-replicating mice. A first antiviral test demonstrated a greater than four orders of magnitude drop in WHV titer in response to interferon Î± treatment. WHV replication was up-regulated by dexamethasone treatment. Comparison of precancerous lesions in donor woodchucks versus recipient uPA/RAG-2 mice revealed an enrichment of dysplastic precancerous hepatocytes in transplanted mice. Clonal amplification of hepatocytes from a woodchuck with hepatocellular carcinomas was demonstrated by the detection of unique WHV DNA integration patterns in hepatocellular carcinomas that arose in uPA/RAG-2 mice. In the absence of B or T cell-mediated immune responses, WHV establishes a persistent noncytotoxic infection of woodchuck hepatocytes in uPA/RAG-2 chimeric mouse livers. Further studies of the kinetics of hepadnavirus infection and replication in quiescent and proliferating hepatocytes should increase our understanding of hepadnavirus spread and aid in the design of therapies to block or cure persistent infection.',\n",

In contrast to the rat liver enzyme, homogeneous preparations of mouse liver, rabbit liver, and pig kidney fructose-bisphosphatase could not be phosphorylated by the kinase. Comparative sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the four above fructose-bisphosphatases revealed that the subunit molecular weight of the isolated rat liver enzyme (ca. 40,000-42,000) was greater than that of mouse liver, rabbit liver, and pig kidney fructose-bisphosphatases (ca. 36,000-37,000). Treatment of 32P-labeled rat liver fructose-bisphosphatase with trypsin resulted in the conversion of the rat liver enzyme to an active species with a subunit molecular weight identical to that of the three other enzymes, with complete loss of the 32P-labeled site. Identical trypsin treatment of pig kidney fructose-bisphosphatase caused no change in the molecular weight of the enzyme. The results suggest that the purified mouse liver, rabbit liver, and pig kidney fructose-bisphosphatases are not substrates for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro because they lack the phosphorylation-site peptide.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Clinical application of doxorubicin is limited because of its potential side effects. The present study examined whether naringin had protective actions on doxorubicin-induced liver injury. Male BALB/c mice and alpha mouse liver 12 (AML-12) cells were used in this paper. The results showed that AML-12 cells treated with naringin significantly reduced cell injury, reactive oxygen species release and apoptosis level; Moreover, naringin notably alleviated liver injury by decreasing aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and malondialdehyde, and increasing superoxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase levels. Mechanism researches indicated that naringin increased the expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and inhibited the downstream inflammatory, apoptotic and oxidative stress signaling pathways. Further validation was obtained by knocking down SIRT1 in vitro, which proved the effects of naringin on doxorubicin-induced liver injury. Therefore, naringin is a valuable lead compound for preventing doxorubicin-induced liver damage by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via up-regulation of SIRT1.',\n",

We minimize the taRNA scaffold to 94 nucleotides, identify two translation initiation factor proteins responsible for taRNA activity, and validate the technology by amplifying SYNGAP1 expression, a haploinsufficiency disease target, in patient-derived cells.

Here, using cre-lox technology, we deleted the Apc gene in the adult mouse liver and observed a rapid increase in nuclear Î²-catenin and c-Myc, which is associated with an induction of proliferation that led to hepatomegaly within 4 days of gene deletion. To investigate the downstream pathways responsible for these phenotypes, we analyzed the impact of inactivating APC in the context of deficiency of the potentially key effectors Î²-catenin and c-Myc. Î²-catenin loss rescues both the proliferation and hepatomegaly phenotypes after APC loss. However, c-Myc deletion, which rescues the phenotypes of APC loss in the intestine, had no effect on the phenotypes of APC loss in the liver. The consequences of the deregulation of the Wnt pathway within the liver are therefore strikingly different from those observed within the intestine, with the vast majority of Wnt targets being Î²-catenin-dependent but c-Myc-independent in the liver.',\n",

The integrated vectors were rescued from total genomic DNA with high efficiency by in vitro packaging and propagation of the phages in a LacZ- strain of Escherichia coli C. The background mutation frequencies in brain and liver DNA appeared to be low, as was indicated by the absence of colorless plaques among 138,816 and 168,160 phage isolated from brain and liver DNA, respectively. Treatment of adult female transgenic mice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the frequency of mutated vectors isolated from brain DNA, up to 7.4 x 10(-5) at 250 mg of the alkylating agent per kilogram of body weight. At this dose, in liver DNA of the same mice, mutation frequencies were approximately 3 x 10(-5). DNA sequence analysis of four mutant vectors isolated from brain DNA indicated predominantly G.C----A.T transitions.

Biochemical and metabolomics studies revealed that loss of ERRÎ± promotes hepatocyte necrosis over apoptosis in response to a carcinogen due to a deficiency in energy production. In addition, we demonstrate that loss of ERRÎ±-dependent regulation of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) inhibitor IÎºBÎ± leads to enhanced NF-ÎºB activity and cytokine gene activation. These findings have particular biological significance in view that rapamycin, a drug currently in use in various clinical settings, has been shown recently to decrease ERRÎ± protein levels and activity in mouse liver.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The toxicity assessment of Lagocephalus inermis, commonly known as smooth blassop, which is commercially exploited in the south-eastern Arabian Sea, was conducted in this study, marking the first of its kind for the region. The experiment involved testing control and standard samples during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Gross anatomical features were observed, followed by histopathological examination of hearts, livers, and kidneys of deceased mice to determine toxicity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze standard tetrodotoxin (TTX) concentrations, which showed characteristic peaks at retention times of 4.83 min (mins), 4.792 min, 4.748 min, and 4.729 min for concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml, 0.08 mg/ml, 0.06 mg/ml, and 0.04 mg/ml, respectively. However, the test samples consisting of liver, ovary, and muscle extracts did not exhibit any characteristic peak indicating the presence of TTX in both seasons. Furthermore, bioassays conducted on the test samples did not show any toxicity symptoms, while standard test mice exhibited characteristic symptoms of TTX poisoning. Histopathological examinations revealed congestion, necrosis, degeneration, and hemorrhages in the liver, heart, and kidney tissues of the standard sample, but no changes were observed in the test sample. Based on the findings, it was concluded that Lagocephalus inermis, as exploited along the Karnataka coast, is not toxic at present. However, considering that the bacteria responsible for the species' toxicity may not be sufficiently present to cause toxicity at the current time, it is imperative for Indian food sanitation authorities to continuously monitor and assess the toxicity of pufferfish consumed in terms of food safety.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mechanistic study and precision treatment of primary liver cancer (PLC) are hindered by marked heterogeneity, which is challenging to recapitulate in any given liver cancer mouse model. Here, we report the generation of 25 mouse models of PLC by in situ genome editing of hepatocytes recapitulating 25 single or combinations of human cancer driver genes. These mouse tumors represent major histopathological types of human PLCs and could be divided into three human-matched molecular subtypes based on transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Phenotypical characterization identified subtype- or genotype-specific alterations in immune microenvironment, metabolic reprogramming, cell proliferation, and expression of drug targets. Furthermore, single-cell analysis and expression tracing revealed spatial and temporal dynamics in expression of pyruvate kinase M2 ( Pkm2 ). Tumor-specific knockdown of Pkm2 by multiplexed genome editing reversed the Warburg effect and suppressed tumorigenesis in a genotype-specific manner. Our study provides mouse PLC models with defined genetic drivers and characterized phenotypical heterogeneity suitable for mechanistic investigation and preclinical testing. Mouse liver tumor model panel reveals diverse human-matched and therapy-related phenotypical and molecular characters.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD), characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, is closely linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and changes in lipogenesis in the liver. The accumulation of hepatic lipids can lead to a range of pathologies from mild steatosis to severe cirrhosis. Endurance exercise is known to ameliorate the adverse health effects of NAFLD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of voluntary wheel running (VWR) on the metabolic changes in the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and used LC-MS/MS (Liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry) to determine whether the tested intervention affected the protein expression profiles of the mouse livers. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: control (CON), high-fat diet sedentary group (HFD), high-fat diet VWR group (HFX). HFX group performed voluntary wheel running into individually cages, given a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Food consumption, body weight, and running distance were measured every week. Using 2D (2-dimensional)-gel electrophoresis, we detected and quantitatively analyzed the protein expression with &gt;2.0-fold change in the livers of HFD-fed mice, HFD-fed exercise (HFX) mice, and chow-fed mice. Body weight was significantly increased in HFD compared to CON (P &lt; 0.05). The 2D-gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that there was a difference between CON and HFD groups, showing 31 increased and 27 decreased spots in the total 302 paired spots in the HFD group compared to CON. The analysis showed 43 increased and 17 decreased spots in the total 258 spots in the HFX group compared to CON. Moreover, 12 weeks of VWR showed an increase of 35 and a decrease of 8 spots in a total of 264 paired spots between HFD and HFX. LC-MS/MS of HFD group revealed that proteins involved in ketogenesis, lipid metabolism, and the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics were upregulated, whereas detoxifying proteins, mitochondrial precursors, transport proteins, proteasomes, and proteins involved in amino acid metabolism were downregulated. On the other hand, VWR counteracted the protein expression profile of HFD-fed mice by upregulating molecular chaperones, gluconeogenesis-, detoxification-, proteasome-, and energy metabolism-related proteins. This study provided a molecular understanding of the HFD- and exercise-induced protein marker expression and presented the beneficial effects of exercise during pathophysiological conditions.',\n",

A study was initiated to elucidate whether such variations of microelement levels are reflected even at the tissue level. Two pools of samples were studied, viz. healthy tissue and tissue where perturbation of the microelement level had occurred through exposure to lead. The organ selected was the mouse liver. Small samples were excised from the same location of each of the four lobes and tissue sections prepared for elemental characterisation in the nuclear microprobe. The specimens were scanned in a raster pattern. The X-ray spectrum was continuously recorded together with the actual Cartesian coordinates. The tissue sections were thus characterised through elemental maps. The maps from the control group displayed small variations between the elemental contents of the different sampling areas; the elements considered were sulphur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc and bromine. The inter-cellular variations were generally small. The maps from the group which had been exposed to lead showed a marked variation in lead content both between different individual parts of the sections and between different sampling areas.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Circadian rhythms of cell and organismal physiology are controlled by an autoregulatory transcription-translation feedback loop that regulates the expression of rhythmic genes in a tissue-specific manner. Recent studies have suggested that components of the circadian pacemaker, such as the Clock and Per2 gene products, regulate a wide variety of processes, including obesity, sensitization to cocaine, cancer susceptibility, and morbidity to chemotherapeutic agents. To identify a more complete cohort of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by CLOCK and/or circadian rhythms, we used a DNA array interrogating the mouse protein-encoding transcriptome to measure gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle from WT and Clock mutant mice. In WT tissue, we found that a large percentage of expressed genes were transcription factors that were rhythmic in either muscle or liver, but not in both, suggesting that tissue-specific output of the pacemaker is regulated in part by a transcriptional cascade. In comparing tissues from WT and Clock mutant mice, we found that the Clock mutation affects the expression of many genes that are rhythmic in WT tissue, but also profoundly affects many nonrhythmic genes. In both liver and skeletal muscle, a significant number of CLOCK-regulated genes were associated with the cell cycle and cell proliferation. To determine whether the observed patterns in cell-cycle gene expression in Clock mutants resulted in functional dysregulation, we compared proliferation rates of fibroblasts derived from WT or Clock mutant embryos and found that the Clock mutation significantly inhibits cell growth and proliferation.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Chemical or traumatic damage to the liver is frequently associated with aberrant healing (fibrosis) that overrides liver regeneration. The mechanism by which hepatic niche cells differentially modulate regeneration and fibrosis during liver repair remains to be defined. Hepatic vascular niche predominantly represented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells deploys paracrine trophogens, known as angiocrine factors, to stimulate regeneration. Nevertheless, it is not known how pro-regenerative angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is subverted to promote fibrosis. Here, by combining an inducible endothelial-cell-specific mouse gene deletion strategy and complementary models of acute and chronic liver injury, we show that divergent angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulate regeneration after immediate injury and provoke fibrosis after chronic insult. The pro-fibrotic transition of vascular niche results from differential expression of stromal-derived factor-1 receptors, CXCR7 and CXCR4 (refs 18, 19, 20, 21), in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. After acute injury, CXCR7 upregulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells acts with CXCR4 to induce transcription factor Id1, deploying pro-regenerative angiocrine factors and triggering regeneration. Inducible deletion of Cxcr7 in sinusoidal endothelial cells (Cxcr7<SUP>iÎEC/iÎEC</SUP>) from the adult mouse liver impaired liver regeneration by diminishing Id1-mediated production of angiocrine factors. By contrast, after chronic injury inflicted by iterative hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) injection and bile duct ligation, constitutive FGFR1 signalling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells counterbalanced CXCR7-dependent pro-regenerative response and augmented CXCR4 expression. This predominance of CXCR4 over CXCR7 expression shifted angiocrine response of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation of desmin<SUP>+</SUP> hepatic stellate-like cells and enforcing a pro-fibrotic vascular niche. Endothelial-cell-specific ablation of either Fgfr1 (Fgfr1<SUP>iÎEC/iÎEC</SUP>) or Cxcr4 (Cxcr4<SUP>iÎEC/iÎEC</SUP>) in mice restored the pro-regenerative pathway and prevented FGFR1-mediated maladaptive subversion of angiocrine factors. Similarly, selective CXCR7 activation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells abrogated fibrogenesis. Thus, we demonstrate that in response to liver injury, differential recruitment of pro-regenerative CXCR7-Id1 versus pro-fibrotic FGFR1-CXCR4 angiocrine pathways in vascular niche balances regeneration and fibrosis. These results provide a therapeutic roadmap to achieve hepatic regeneration without provoking fibrosis.',\n",

The discovery of carcinogenic peroxisome proliferators, which markedly increase the levels of this H2O2-producing ACOX in rat and mouse liver, generated interest in peroxisomal beta-oxidation system genes. The present study deals with the structural organization of human ACOX gene. This gene spans approximately 33 kb and consists of 14 exons and 13 introns. Primer-extension analysis revealed three principal cap sites, which were mapped at 50, 52, and 53 nt upstream of the initiator methionine codon. The 5\\' flanking region of the ACOX gene was sequenced up to 500 bp upstream of the cap sites. This promoter region is G + C-rich and contains three copies of the \"GC box\" hexanucleotides. Multiple GC boxes are a characteristic feature of the rat ACOX and bifunctional protein genes of the beta-oxidation system. A + T-rich TATA-boxlike sequences, TTTATTT and TTATT, have also been identified in this human ACOX gene, but typical CCAAT motifs are absent. This ACOX gene has been mapped to chromosome 17q25 by in situ hybridization, using a biotinlabeled probe.',\n",

Analysis of liver cDNA from a mouse strain expressing the neomycin resistance gene demonstrated that this procedure is capable of identifying species present in one population but absent from another. Furthermore, experiments to identify genes with circadian expression patterns in mouse liver demonstrated that SABRE is capable of detecting even modest 2- to 10-fold differences in accumulation of moderately rare mRNA species, representing as little as 0.03% of total mRNA.

Our research group found that Diosmin also has anti-radiation effect, and the anti-radiation mechanism of Diosmin was studied through in vitro cell experiments, animal experiments and differential protein spots of mouse liver radiation-damaged proteins to obtain the following results: (1) Cell experiment: The splenic lymphocytes of Rattus norvegicus (SD rats) and PC12 cells were cultured in vitro and irradiated by 60Co-Î³ ray. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the addition of Diosmin to the cells before irradiation to the final concentration of 80Î¼g/ml, can promote cell proliferation and improve cell survival. Meanwhile, at this dose, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) increased and the content of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased. By measuring the cell cycle and apoptosis in PC12 cells, it was found that Diosmin can promote cell differentiation and reduce the damage brought about by irradiation of cells. (2) Animal experiments: By establishing 60Co-Î³ray irradiation model, the indices of Kunming mice given Diosmin continually for 14 days were measured. It was noted that Diosmin can play a protective role in white blood cells and immune organs such as liver and spleen. The activities of SOD and GSH-px in mouse tissues were improved and the content of MDA, the rate of chromosome aberration and micronuclei in bone marrow decreased.

The peak area value of amide A significantly decrease from 288.278 Â± 3.121 to 189.872 Â± 2.012 between control and aluminium treated liver tissue respectively.

This result suggests an alteration in the protein profile. The absence of olefinicdbnd CH stretching band and Cdbnd O stretching of triglycerides in aluminium treated liver suggests an altered lipid levels due to aluminium exposure. Significant shift in the peak position of glycogen may be the interruption of aluminium in the calcium metabolism and the reduced level of calcium. The overall findings exhibit that the liver metabolic program is altered through increasing the structural modification in proteins, triglycerides and quantitative alteration in proteins, lipids, and glycogen. All the above mentioned modifications were protected in desferrioxamine treated mice. Histopathological results also revealed impairment of aluminium induced alterations in liver tissue.

       "    'abstract': 'Oxysterols are bioactive lipids derived from cholesterol that are linked to inflammatory processes. Because obesity and metabolic syndrome are characterized by inflammation and altered cholesterol metabolism, we sought to investigate the variations of oxysterol levels and their metabolic pathways induced by obesity in the liver, hypothalamus, adipose tissue and plasma. To this end, we used diet-induced and genetic (ob/ob and db/db) models of obesity. Among the oxysterols measured, we found that 4Î²-oxysterol levels were consistently decreased in the high-fat diet study, at different time-points, and in the ob/ob model. Overall, we did not find any correlation between cytochromes mRNA expression and variations of oxysterol levels. We also measured the levels of hepatic primary bile acids, in these three models and found similar profiles between HFD and ob/ob mice. However, although they are downstream metabolites of oxysterols, the variations in bile acid levels did not reflect the variations of their precursors. Our data show that, when considering oxysterol metabolism, the high-fat diet and ob/ob models are more closely related when compared to the db/db model. However, we were able to discriminate between lean and obese phenotypes based on liver oxysterol (4Î²-hydroxycholesterol, 27- hydroxycholesterol, 7-hydroxycholestenone) levels and enzyme (CYP3A11, CYP27A1, CYP7A1) expression.',\n",

MAM dysfunction has been related to liver disease. We report a high-throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomics characterization of MAMs from mouse liver, which portrays them as an extremely complex compartment involved in different metabolic processes, including steroid metabolism. Interestingly, we identified caveolin-1 (CAV1) as an integral component of hepatic MAMs, which determine the relative cholesterol content of these ER subdomains. Finally, a detailed comparative proteomics analysis between MAMs from wild type and CAV1-deficient mice suggests that functional CAV1 contributes to the recruitment and regulation of intracellular steroid and lipoprotein metabolism-related processes accrued at MAMs. The potential impact of these novel aspects of CAV1 biology on global cell homeostasis and disease is discussed.',\n",

Here, we show that YAP activation induced by inactivation of the Hippo pathway specifically in damaged hepatocytes promotes their selective elimination by using in vivo mosaic analysis in mouse liver. These damaged hepatocytes migrate into the hepatic sinusoids, undergo apoptosis and are engulfed by Kupffer cells. In contrast, YAP activation in undamaged hepatocytes leads to proliferation. Cellular stresses such as ethanol that damage both liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes switch cell fate from proliferation to migration/apoptosis in the presence of activated YAP. This involves the activation of CDC42 and Rac that regulate cell migration. Thus, we suggest that YAP acts as a stress sensor that induces elimination of injured cells to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis.',\n",

In postnatal Bmi-1<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice, the number of HSCs was markedly reduced.

       "    'abstract': 'The mammalian clock regulates major aspects of energy metabolism, including glucose and lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The biochemical basis for coordinated control of the circadian clock and diverse metabolic pathways is not well understood. Here we show that PGC-1Î± (Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism, is rhythmically expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle of mice. PGC-1Î± stimulates the expression of clock genes, notably Bmal1 (Arntl) and Rev-erbÎ± (Nr1d1), through coactivation of the ROR family of orphan nuclear receptors. Mice lacking PGC-1Î± show abnormal diurnal rhythms of activity, body temperature and metabolic rate. The disruption of physiological rhythms in these animals is correlated with aberrant expression of clock genes and those involved in energy metabolism. Analyses of PGC-1Î±-deficient fibroblasts and mice with liver-specific knockdown of PGC-1Î± indicate that it is required for cell-autonomous clock function. We have thus identified PGC-1Î± as a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism.',\n",

Compared with the PBS group, the body-weight gain of the mice decreased and the level of total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase increased in the MWCNT-exposed group with a significant dose-effect relationship, while tumor necrosis factor alpha level did not show significant statistical change within 60 d. Spotty necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration in portal region, hepatocyte mitochondria swelling and lysis were observed with a significant dose-effect relationship in the MWCNT groups. Liver damage of the T-MWCNT group was more severe than that of the O-MWCNT group according to the Roenigk classification system. Furthermore, T-MWCNTs induce slight liver oxidative damage in mice at 15 d, which was recovered at 60 d. Part of the gene expressions of mouse liver in the MWCNT groups changed compared to the PBS group, including GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism by cytochrome P450, natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, TNF- Î±, NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, etc. In the P450 pathway, the gene expressions of Gsta2 (down-regulated), Cyp2B19 (up-regulated) and Cyp2C50 (down-regulated) had significant changes in the MWCNT groups. These results show that a high dose of T-MWCNTs can induce hepatic toxicity in mice while O-MWCNTs seem to have less toxicity.',\n",

Use of radioactive labeling of acid-soluble nucleotides to high specific activity followed by chromatographic separation techniques yielded levels of Ap4A varying from 5 to 0.05 muM (from 30 pmol/mg of protein to 0.15 pmol), depending on the doubling time of the cell line or the proliferative state of the cells. The levels of Ap4A incells is inversely related to their doubling time, varying from 0.1 X 10(-4) of the cellular ATP levels in slowly growing cells to 20 X 10(-4) of the ATP levels of cells with rapid doubling times. The steady-state levels of ATP of different cell lines, although showing some fluctuations, are not related to the doubling time of the cells. Arrest of cellular proliferation by serum deprivation or amino acid starvation, which does not alter the cellular ATP levels more than 2-fold, does nevertheless cause a decrease of 30 to 50-fold in the Ap4A levels. Inhibition of protein synthesis by pactamycin or puromycin, or inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea, leads to a more dramatic decrease of 50 to 100-fold in intracellular Ap4A levels. The metabolic lability of Ap4A is also demonstrated by its rapid depletion after decreases in the ATP/ADP ratio. The possibility of Ap4A being a metabolic \"signal nucleotide\" that is formed at the onset of protein synthesis and is active in positive growth regulation (positive pleiotypic activation) is discussed.',\n",

Furthermore, ablation of IL-6 abolished the gender differences in hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. DEN exposure promoted production of IL-6 in Kupffer cells (KCs) in a manner dependent on the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88, ablation of which also protected male mice from DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Estrogen inhibited secretion of IL-6 from KCs exposed to necrotic hepatocytes and reduced circulating concentrations of IL-6 in DEN-treated male mice.

Here, we characterize a unique type of polarity found in liver tissue, nematic cell polarity, which is different from vectorial cell polarity in simple, sheet-like epithelia. We propose a conceptual and algorithmic framework to characterize complex patterns of polarity proteins on the surface of a cell in terms of a multipole expansion. To rigorously quantify previously observed tissue-level patterns of nematic cell polarity (Morales-Navarette et al., eLife 8:e44860, 2019), we introduce the concept of co-orientational order parameters, which generalize the known biaxial order parameters of the theory of liquid crystals. Applying these concepts to three-dimensional reconstructions of single cells from high-resolution imaging data of mouse liver tissue, we show that the axes of nematic cell polarity of hepatocytes exhibit local coordination and are aligned with the biaxially anisotropic sinusoidal network for blood transport. Our study characterizes liver tissue as a biological example of a biaxial liquid crystal. The general methodology developed here could be applied to other tissues or in-vitro organoids.',\n",

Our previous studies have shown that hormonal induction of C4-Slp is mediated by a sex-specific pattern of growth hormone secretion. Promoter analyses in vitro have led to contradictory conclusions concerning the significance of C4-Slp-specific sequences in the 5' flanking region. Mutant mice carrying the H-2<SUP>aw18</SUP> haplotype, which is characterized by a large deletion in the S region covering the C4 and 21-OHase A genes, permit the direct in vivo analysis of C4-Slp transcription, unhindered by the presence of C4. Run-on analysis of transcription in liver nuclei of males and females of this strain demonstrated a 100-fold higher transcriptional activity in males, essentially determined at the transcription initiation level. The androgen dependence of transcription initiation was confirmed by run-on analysis of testosterone-treated females, where transcriptional activity started after 6 days of androgen treatment and reached male levels after 20 days. Conversely, the growth hormone-regulated activity of transcription factor STAT5 was already detected in liver nuclei after 48 hr of androgen treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activated STAT5 recognizes in vitro two upstream Î³ interferon-activated sequence (GAS) elements of the C4-Slp gene, centered at positions -1969 and -1831. We postulate that binding of STAT5 to these C4-Slp-specific GAS elements plays a crucial role in the chromatin remodelings that lead to transcriptional competence of the C4-Slp gene in the liver.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The forkhead box (Fox) family of transcription factors share homology in the winged helix/forkhead DNA-binding domain and play important roles in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, longevity, and cellular transformation. Forkhead box M1B (FoxM1B) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Fox transcription factor family whose expression is restricted to proliferating cells and that mediates hepatocyte entry into DNA synthesis and mitosis during liver regeneration. Recent cDNA microarray studies indicated that age-related defects in cellular proliferation are associated with diminished expression of the FoxM1B transcription factor. Here, we show that increased levels of FoxM1B in regenerating liver of old transgenic mice restore the sharp peaks in hepatocyte DNA replication and mitosis that are the hallmarks of young regenerating mouse liver. Restoration of the young regenerating liver phenotype is associated with increased expression of numerous cell cycle regulatory genes that include cyclin D1, cyclin A2, cyclin F, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, Cdc25B, and p55cdc. Cotransfection assays in the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line demonstrated that FoxM1B protein stimulated expression of both the cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 promoters, suggesting that these cyclin genes are a direct FoxM1B transcriptional target. These results suggest that FoxM1B controls the transcriptional network of genes that are essential for cell division and exit from mitosis. Our results indicate that reduced expression of the FoxM1B transcription factor contributes to the decline in cellular proliferation observed in the aging process.',\n",

In adult mammals, findings of transdifferentiation have been limited to the replenishment of cells lost from preexisting structures, in the presence of a fully developed scaffold and niche<SUP>1</SUP>. Here we show that transdifferentiation of hepatocytes in the mouse liver can build a structure that failed to form in developmentâthe biliary system in a mouse model that mimics the hepatic phenotype of human Alagille syndrome (ALGS)<SUP>2</SUP>. In these mice, hepatocytes convert into mature cholangiocytes and form bile ducts that are effective in draining bile and persist after the cholestatic liver injury is reversed, consistent with transdifferentiation. These findings redefine hepatocyte plasticity, which appeared to be limited to metaplasia, that is, incomplete and transient biliary differentiation as an adaptation to cell injury, based on previous studies in mice with a fully developed biliary system<SUP>3-6</SUP>. In contrast to bile duct development<SUP>7-9</SUP>, we show that de novo bile duct formation by hepatocyte transdifferentiation is independent of NOTCH signalling. We identify TGFÎ² signalling as the driver of this compensatory mechanism and show that it is active in some patients with ALGS. Furthermore, we show that TGFÎ² signalling can be targeted to enhance the formation of the biliary system from hepatocytes, and that the transdifferentiation-inducing signals and remodelling capacity of the bile-duct-deficient liver can be harnessed with transplanted hepatocytes. Our results define the regenerative potential of mammalian transdifferentiation and reveal opportunities for the treatment of ALGS and other cholestatic liver diseases.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Drug-induced liver injury is a frequent side effect of many drugs, constitutes a significant threat to patient health and has an enormous economic impact on health care expenditures. Numerous efforts have been made to identify reliable and predictive markers to detect the early signs of drug-induced injury to the liver, one of the most vulnerable organs in the body. These studies have, however, not delivered any more informative candidates than the serum aminotransferase markers that have been available for â30 years. Using acetaminophen overdose-induced liver injury in the mouse as a model system, we have observed highly significant differences in the spectrum and levels of microRNAs in both liver tissues and in plasma between control and overdosed animals. Based on our survey of microRNA expression among normal tissues, some of the microRNAs, like messenger RNAs, display restricted tissue distributions. A number of elevated circulating microRNAs in plasma collected from acetaminophen-overdosed animals are highly expressed in the liver. We have demonstrated that specific microRNA species, such as mir-122 and mir-192, both are enriched in the liver tissue and exhibit dose- and exposure duration-dependent changes in the plasma that parallel serum aminotransferase levels and the histopathology of liver degeneration, but their changes can be detected significantly earlier. These findings suggest the potential of using specific circulating microRNAs as sensitive and informative biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury.',\n",

In an effort to better understand the role of core promoter recognition and coactivator complex switching in cellular differentiation, we have examined changes in transcription factor IID (TFIID) and cofactor required for Sp1 activation/Mediator during mouse liver development. Here we show that the differentiation of fetal liver progenitors to adult hepatocytes involves a wholesale depletion of canonical cofactor required for Sp1 activation/Mediator and TFIID complexes at both the RNA and protein level, and that this alteration likely involves silencing of transcription factor promoters as well as protein degradation. It will be intriguing for future studies to determine if a novel and as yet unknown core promoter recognition complex takes the place of TFIID in adult hepatocytes and to uncover the mechanisms that down-regulate TFIID during this critical developmental transition.',\n",

The present study is focused on the action of leptin on hepatic metabolism. Nondestructive <SUP>13</SUP>C NMR methodology was used to follow the kinetics of intermediary metabolism by monitoring flux of <SUP>13</SUP>C-labeled substrate through several multistep pathways. In perfused liver from either ob/ob or lean mice, we found that acute treatment with leptin in vitro modulates pathways controlling carbohydrate flux into <SUP>13</SUP>C-labeled glycogen, thereby rapidly enhancing synthesis by an insulin-independent mechanism. Acute treatment of ob/ob liver also caused a rapid stimulation of long-chain fatty acid synthesis from <SUP>13</SUP>C-labeled acetyl-CoA by the de novo synthesis route. Chronic leptin treatment in vivo induced homeostatic changes that resulted in a tripling of the rate of glycogen synthesis via the gluconeogenic pathway from [2-<SUP>13</SUP>C]pyruvate in ob/ob mouse liver perfused in the absence of the hormone. Consistent with the <SUP>13</SUP>C NMR results, leptin treatment of the ob/ob mouse in vivo resulted in significantly increased hepatic glycogen synthase activity. Chronic treatment with leptin in vivo exerted the opposite effect of acute treatment in vitro and markedly decreased hepatic de novo synthesis of fatty acids in ob/ob mouse liver. In agreement with the <SUP>13</SUP>C NMR findings, activities of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase were significantly reduced by chronic treatment of the ob/ob mouse with leptin. Our data represent a demonstration of direct effects of leptin in the regulation of metabolism in the intact functioning liver.\",\n",

At the molecular level, the rhythm-generating mechanism is controlled by a molecular clock composed of positive and negative feedback loops. However, the underlying mechanisms for molecular clock regulation that affect circadian clock function remain unclear. Here, we show that Egr1 (early growth response 1), an early growth response gene, is expressed in mouse liver in a circadian manner. Consistently, Egr1 is transactivated by the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer through a conserved E-box response element. In hepatocytes, EGR1 regulates the transcription of several core clock genes, including Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Rev-erbÎ± and Rev-erbÎ², and the rhythm amplitude of their expression is dependent on EGR1âs transcriptional function. Further mechanistic studies indicated that EGR1 binds to the proximal region of the Per1 promoter to activate its transcription directly. When the peripheral clock is altered by light or feeding behavior transposition in Egr1-deficient mice, the expression phase of hepatic clock genes shifts normally, but the amplitude is also altered. Our data reveal a critical role for EGR1 in the regulation of hepatic clock circuitry, which may contribute to the rhythm stability of peripheral clock oscillators.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major primary malignant tumor in the human liver, but the molecular changes leading to liver cell transformation remain largely unknown. The Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway is activated in colon cancers and some melanoma cell lines, but has not yet been investigated in HCC. We have examined the status of the Î²-catenin gene in different transgenic mouse lines of HCC obtained with the oncogenes c-myc or H-ras. Fifty percent of the hepatic tumors in these transgenic mice had activating somatic mutations within the Î²-catenin gene similar to those found in colon cancers and melanomas. These alterations in the Î²-catenin gene (point mutations or deletions) lead to a disregulation of the signaling function of Î²-catenin and thus to carcinogenesis. We then analyzed human HCCs and found similar mutations in eight of 31 (26%) human liver tumors tested and in HepG2 and HuH6 hepatoma cells. The mutations led to the accumulation of Î²-catenin in the nucleus. Thus alterations in the Î²-catenin gene frequently are selected for during liver tumorigenesis and suggest that disregulation of the Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway is a major event in the development of HCC in humans and mice.',\n",

In the present study, we tested the effect of DNA-PK on AAV serotype 2 integration in vitro and in vivo in mouse liver.

After partial hepatectomy to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation, retention of vector genomes and of transgene expression was substantially higher in severe combined immunodeficient mice, indicating that in the absence of DNA-PKcs, a greater proportion of genomes integrated into the cellular genome.

The complexity curve is obtained by computing the number of black-to-white transitions observed in a binary image for all possible threshold values in a gray-level texture image. The new features characterize the first-order statistics of the complexity curve, and therefore give a second-order description of texture. The set of features is applied to texture classification, and to capture the directionality and the periodicity of texture. For texture classification, two experiments are performed. First, some Brodatz textures are used to evaluate the classification performance of the features. Some of the traditional texture features, extracted from the co-occurrence matrix, have also been used for comparison. Secondly, the features are applied to the classification of Transmission Electron Micrographs of premalignant and malignant cell nuclei in a controlled mouse liver carcinogenesis experiment. Directionality and periodicity are two high-level texture features that guide the process of perceptual grouping of texture images. Therefore, two additional experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of the complexity curve features in estimating the texture directionality and periodicity. <P />The experimental results demonstrate that the new texture features based on the complexity curve are very useful tools for texture analysis.',\n",

In contrast to the canonical TGF-Î² pathway, it is unknown how noncanonical TGF-Î² pathways are negatively regulated. Here we demonstrate that the inhibitory Smad Smad6, but not Smad7, negatively regulates TGF-Î²1-induced activation of the TRAF6-TAK1-p38 MAPK/JNK pathway, a noncanonical TGF-Î² pathway. TGF-Î²1-induced Smad6 abolishes K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 by recruiting the A20 deubiquitinating enzyme in AML-12 mouse liver cells and primary hepatocytes. In addition, the knockdown of Smad6 or A20 in an animal model or cell culture system maintains TAK1 and p38 MAPK/JNK phosphorylation and increases apoptosis, emphasizing the crucial role of the Smad6-A20 axis in negative regulation of the TGF-Î²1-TRAF6-TAK1-p38 MAPK/JNK pathway. Therefore, our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying negative regulation of noncanonical TGF-Î² pathways.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The contribution of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in induction of a battery of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes has been studied extensively. However, no direct proof has been obtained that it plays a role in modulating carcinogenesis. To address the question of whether AhR is required for tumor induction, we have investigated the response of AhR-deficient mice to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a widely distributed environmental carcinogen. B[a]P treatment induced expression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp1a1 in the skin and liver of AhR-positive mice bearing +/+ and +/- genotypes and did not induce expression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp1a1 in AhR-null mice in either skin or liver. In contrast, Cyp1a2 gene expression was positive in liver irrespective of the presence or absence of the AhR gene, or B[a]P treatment, although its inducibility was lost in the AhR(-/-) mouse. All AhR-positive male mice of both +/+ and +/- genotypes that received subcutaneous injection of B[a]P (2 mg) on the first and the eighth days had developed subcutaneous tumors at the site of injection at the end of the 18-week experiment. In contrast, no tumors were apparent in any of the AhR-deficient mice. Likewise, topical application of B[a]P (200 Î¼g) at weekly intervals to the skin of female mice for 25 weeks produced skin tumors only in the AhR-positive mice. Thus the carcinogenic action of B[a]P may be determined primarily by AhR, a transcriptional regulator of the gene for CYP1A1. The results of the present study provide direct evidence that AhR is involved in carcinogenesis.',\n",

Studies of alpha 1-PI and other serine protease inhibitor genes have revealed an unusually high rate of mutation of the reactive centers of the inhibitors. Using a modification of the PCR technique, we have previously identified five distinct alpha 1 PI reactive site sequences present in the genome of C57BL/6 mice. In this report, we use cDNA cloning techniques to demonstrate that all five genes are expressed in the adult mouse liver. DNA sequence analysis shows that three of the five mRNAs expressed have a substitution for methionine-353, which is essential for normal activity of the homologous human protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT). Comparison of the DNA sequences of the five cDNAs indicates a higher degree of polymorphism in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and an extraordinarily replacement/silent ratio of nucleotide changes in a narrow region surrounding the reactive site. The clustering of polymorphisms near the reactive site combined with the high replacement/silent ratio suggest an evolutionary mechanism that apparently selects for functional diversity of the alpha 1-PI genes. Finally, modeling of the three-dimensional positions of the alpha 1-PI polymorphic residues into the homologous positions of the crystallographic structure of ovalbumin, a member of the alpha 1-PI supergene family, predicts that many of these amino acids are on the surfaces, which are likely to interact with the protease targets.',\n",

Stichodactyla toxin (ShK), isolated from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, is a potent blocker of Kv1.3. Several of its analogs are some of the most potent and selective blockers of this channel. However, like most biologics, ShK and its analogs require injections for their delivery, and repeated injections reduce patient compliance during the treatment of chronic diseases. We hypothesized that inducing the expression of an ShK analog by hepatocytes would remove the requirement for frequent injections and lead to a sustained level of Kv1.3 blocker in the circulation. To this goal, we tested the ability of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)8 vectors to target hepatocytes for expressing the ShK analog, ShK-235 (AAV-ShK-235) in rodents. We designed AAV8 vectors expressing the target transgene, ShK-235, or Enhanced Green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Transduction of mouse livers led to the production of sufficient levels of functional ShK-235 in the serum from AAV-ShK-235 single-injected mice to block Kv1.3 channels. However, AAV-ShK-235 therapy was not effective in reducing high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice. In addition, injection of even high doses of AAV8-ShK-235 to rats resulted in a very low liver transduction efficiency and failed to reduce inflammation in a well-established rat model of delayed-type hypersensitivity. In conclusion, the AAV8-based delivery of ShK-235 was highly effective in inducing the secretion of functional Kv1.3-blocking peptide in mouse, but not rat, hepatocytes yet did not reduce obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate expression of protein-coding genes in cis through chromatin modifications including DNA methylation. Here we interrogated whether lncRNA genes may regulate transcription and methylation of their flanking or overlapping protein-coding genes in livers of mice exposed to a 12-week cholesterol-rich Western-style high fat diet (HFD) relative to a standard diet (STD). Deconvolution analysis of cell type-specific marker gene expression suggested similar hepatic cell type composition in HFD and STD livers. RNA-seq and validation by nCounter technology revealed differential expression of 14 lncRNA genes and 395 protein-coding genes enriched for functions in steroid/cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, lipid localization, and circadian rhythm. While lncRNA and protein-coding genes were co-expressed in 53 lncRNA/protein-coding gene pairs, both were differentially expressed only in 4 lncRNA/protein-coding gene pairs, none of which included protein-coding genes in overrepresented pathways. Furthermore, 5-methylcytosine DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and targeted bisulfite sequencing revealed no differential DNA methylation of genes in overrepresented pathways. These results suggest lncRNA/protein-coding gene interactions in cis play a minor role mediating hepatic expression of lipid metabolism/localization and circadian clock genes in response to chronic HFD feeding.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a widely used hepatotoxin for the studies of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and taurine has function to abate liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. But the interacting mechanisms between taurine and CCl4 in liver are still largely unknown. These made us to hypothesize that CCl4 may induce liver fibrosis by affecting the expressions of taurine biosynthetic enzymes and taurine synthesis. We thus assayed the expressions of hepatic cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), cysteine sulfonate acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and taurine transporter (TauT) in the progression of mouse liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. The results demonstrated that CCl4 treatment markedly decreased hepatic CSAD, CDO expressions, and taurine levels in hepatic tissue, although TauT expression did not exhibit significant decline. It was contrasting that hepatic Î±-SMA, serum AST, ALT, ALP kept increasing, which were accompanied by the pathological characters of liver, whereas taurine supplement attenuated the progression of liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. These results demonstrate that CCl4 may induce liver fibrosis by inhibiting hepatic CSAD and CDO expressions and taurine synthesis, which are crucial for our understanding the mechanisms of liver fibrosis induced by CCl4, and also potential for establishing therapeutic strategies of liver fibrosis and related diseases.',\n",

Stat5b-Ct is tyrosine phosphorylated by purified IR kinase domain in vitro. Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of overexpressed Stat5b-Ct and endogenous Stat5 in cells overexpressing IR. Stat5 may be a direct target of the IR and, as a member of the Stat family of transcription factors, may play a role in the regulation of gene transcription by insulin. In support of this hypothesis, perfusion of mouse liver with insulin promotes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 and activation of Stat5 DNA binding. Moreover, refeeding of fasted mice leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of enhanced DNA-binding activity of Stat5 extracted from liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that IR interacts with and phosphorylates Stat5 in vitro and in tissues physiologically sensitive to insulin.',\n",

In this study, four-week-old Kunming mice were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The time-varying distribution of ICG in mice was obtained by diffuse fluorescence tomography reconstruction, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were further extracted from the ICG concentration-time curve. The results showed that the dynamic diffuse fluorescence tomography system successfully captured the ICG metabolism process in mouse liver, and the ICG excretion rate demonstrated an obvious difference between healthy mice and the mice with acute alcoholic liver injury.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Advances in systems biology have allowed for global analyses of mRNA and protein expression, but large-scale studies of protein dynamics and turnover have not been conducted in vivo. Protein turnover is an important metabolic and regulatory mechanism in establishing proteome homeostasis, impacting many physiological and pathological processes. Here, we have used organism-wide isotopic labeling to measure the turnover rates of ~2,500 proteins in multiple mouse tissues, spanning four orders of magnitude. Through comparison of the brain with the liver and blood, we show that within the respective tissues, proteins performing similar functions often have similar turnover rates. Proteins in the brain have significantly slower turnover (average lifetime of 9.0 d) compared with those of the liver (3.0 d) and blood (3.5 d). Within some organelles (such as mitochondria), proteins have a narrow range of lifetimes, suggesting a synchronized turnover mechanism. Protein subunits within complexes of variable composition have a wide range of lifetimes, whereas those within well-defined complexes turn over in a coordinated manner. Together, the data represent the most comprehensive in vivo analysis of mammalian proteome turnover to date. The developed methodology can be adapted to assess in vivo proteome homeostasis in any model organism that will tolerate a labeled diet and may be particularly useful in the analysis of neurodegenerative diseases in vivo.',\n",

However, it has the drawback of addressing only CpGs in the context of the CCGG site, leaving out the remainder of the possible 16 XCGX tetranucleotides in which CpGs are found. We expanded MSCC to include three additional enzymes to address a total of 5 of the 16 XCGX combinations. This allowed us to survey methylation at about one-third of all a mammalian genome's CpGs. Applied to mouse liver DNA, we correctly confirmed data reported with other methods showing hypomethylation to be concentrated at promoters and in CpG islands (CGIs), with gene bodies and intergenic regions being mostly methylated. Grouping unmethylated CpGs, characterized by high MSCC scores (7% false discovery rate), we found a large number of unmethylated regions not qualifying as CGIs located in intergenic and intronic regions, which are highly enriched in functional DNA sequences (open regulatory annotation database) as well as in noncoding yet highly conserved mammalian sequences thought to be important but with as yet unknown function. About 50% of MSCC-defined unmethylated regions do not overlap algorithm-defined CGIs and offer a novel search space in which new functionalities of DNA may be found in health and disease.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Detecting recurrent patterns in time series data is an important capability. The reason is that repeating patterns on the one hand indicate well defined processes that can be further analyzed once detected and on the other hand are a reliable feature to predict future occurrences and adapt accordingly. The challenge in real data to define a period is that a time series is usually also influenced by non-periodic dynamics and noise. In this work, a mathematical framework is proved to define regular patterns. Their properties are used within a suggested algorithm based on the concept of autocorrelation and function approximation to fit a model capturing the periodic part of the time series. Based on that model and a corresponding autocorrelation, a new score is defined to evaluate how well a hypothesized period fits to the time series. This score is particularly useful in a big data scenario where decisions for periodicity are needed to be taken automatically, which is one of the main achievement of the presented work. The period analysis algorithm is applied to data from two different use cases. The first one is a data center scenario where the information of the periodic pattern is used to create a feature that improves a machine learning framework predicting future resource demands. The feature represents the phase of the repeating pattern. In a second scenario, expression data from mice liver cells are investigated concerning periodic rhythms. A Python implementation of the presented algorithm is provided via a github repository under https://github.com/LauritzR/period-detection.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The process of lipid droplet (LD) formation is an evolutionarily conserved process among all eukaryotes and plays an important role in both cellular physiology and disease. Recently, fat storage-inducing transmembrane proteins 1 and 2 (FIT1/FITM1 and FIT2/FITM2) were discovered as an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins involved in fat storage. In mammals, FIT1 is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle and FIT2 is expressed primarily in adipose, raising the possibility that FIT1 and FIT2 have unique functions. These proteins are exclusively localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate triglyceride-rich LD accumulation when overexpressed in cells, mouse liver, or muscle. Unlike the ER-resident diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase family of triglyceride-synthesizing enzymes, FITs do not synthesize triglyceride, but rather partition triglyceride into LDs. The mechanism by which FIT proteins mediate this process has not been determined. A simple hypothesis was tested that FIT proteins bind to triglyceride to mediate LD formation. Here, it is shown that FIT proteins purified in detergent micelles directly bind triolein with specificity and saturation-binding kinetics. A FIT2 gain-of-function mutant that formed larger LDs, FLL(157-9)AAA, showed increased binding to triolein relative to wild-type FIT2, whereas FIT1 and a FIT2 partial loss-of-function mutant, N80A, had significantly lower triolein binding and produced smaller LDs. In summary, FIT proteins are transmembrane domain-containing proteins shown to bind triglyceride. These findings indicate that FITs have a unique biochemical mechanism in mediating LD formation and implicates triglyceride binding as important for FIT-mediated LD formation.',\n",

This defect results in activation of macrophages in many tissues, progressive liver disease, and neurodegeneration. In the npc1<SUP>â/â</SUP> mouse, a model of this disease, the whole-animal C pool expands from 2,082 to 4,925 mg/kg body weight (bw) and the hepatic C pool increases from 132 to 1,485 mg/kg bw between birth and 49 days of age. A single dose of 2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (CYCLO) administered at 7 days of age immediately caused this sequestered C to flow from the lysosomes to the cytosolic pool in many organs, resulting in a marked increase in cholesteryl esters, suppression of C but not fatty acid synthesis, down-regulation of genes controlled by sterol regulatory element 2, and up-regulation of many liver X receptor target genes. There was also decreased expression of proinflammatory proteins in the liver and brain. In the liver, where the rate of C sequestration equaled 79 mg.d<SUP>â1</SUP>.kg<SUP>â1</SUP>, treatment with CYCLO within 24 h increased C movement out of the E/L compartment from near 0 to 233 mg.d<SUP>â1</SUP>.kg<SUP>â1</SUP>. By 49 days of age, this single injection of CYCLO resulted in a reduction in whole-body C burden of &gt;900 mg/kg, marked improvement in liver function tests, much less neurodegeneration, and, ultimately, significant prolongation of life.

Through application of stringent combinatorial criteria, the transgenic/knockout approach allows identification of genes whose activities are likely to be controlled directly by one family of transcription factors, in this case the SREBPs.',\n",

Forty female BALB/c mice, aged 6-8 weeks old received a single i.p. injection of 0.5 cc pristane for lupus induction. 16 weeks after injection, pristane-induced lupus mice were divided into four groups based on the doses of Bryophyllum pinnatum received intragastrically: 0, 10.5 mg/kg/, 21 mg/kg/, and 42 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. At 38 weeks after injection, all mice were assessed for inflammation marker. Side effects study results suggest that there were no signs of side effects generally. No significant changes of blood pressure, liver and mice renal function were observed. The efficacy study showed that percentages of matured B cells, TNF-Î±, CRP, IL-17, and IL-12 decreased (p&lt;0.05) and percentages of TGF-Î² and complement C3 and C4 increased (p&gt;0.05) in Bryophyllum pinnatum treated mice.

       "    'abstract': 'Obesity has become more prevalent in most developed countries over the past few decades, and is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for several common types of cancer. As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in obesity-associated cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, indicating that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer and open up new possibilities for its control.',\n",

In both mouse and rat the first histological sign of morphogenesis of the dorsal pancreas is a dorsal evagination of the duodenum at the level of the liver at around the 22-25-somite stage, and shortly thereafter a ventral evagination appears as a derivative of the liver diverticulum<SUP>1-3</SUP>. Low levels of insulin gene transcripts are already present and restricted to the dorsal foregut endoderm at 20 somites, suggesting that pancreas- or insulin gene-specific transcriptional factors are present in this region before the onset of morphogenesis4. Insulin-promoter-factor 1 (IPF1) is a homeodomain protein which, in the adult mouse pancreas, is selectively expressed in the Î²-cells and binds to and transactivates the insulin promoter<SUP>5</SUP>. In mouse embryos, IPF1 expression is restricted to the developing pancreatic anlagen and is initiated when the foregut endoderm is committed to a pancreatic fate<SUP>5</SUP>. We now show that mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the Ipf1 gene selectively lack a pancreas. The mutant pups survive fetal development but die within a few days after birth. The gastrointestinal part and all other internal organs were normal in appearance. No pancreatic tissue and no ectopic expression of insulin or pancreatic amylase could be detected in mutant embryos and neonates. These findings show that IPF1 is needed for the formation of the pancreas and suggest that it acts to determine the fate of common pancreatic precursor cells and/ or to regulate their propagation.',\n",

This 14S mRNA was used for the enzymatic synthesis of DNA (cDNA) which is complementary to the RNA template. A DNA fraction was isolated which has an average size of 300 nucleotides. Kinetic studies of the hybridization of the 14S RNA with the cDNA indicate that about 40% of the RNA consists of a single RNA sequence. From the size of the cDNA fraction and from the direction of DNA synthesis, it can be concluded that the cDNA includes the sequence complementary to the constant region of light chain mRNA. This radioactive cDNA was used for DNA.DNA reannealing experiments with unlabeled DNA from mouse liver or myeloma tumor in 3 Ã 10<SUP>6</SUP>-fold excess.

       "    'abstract': 'Image-based analysis of the vascular structures of murine liver samples is an important tool for scientists to understand liver physiology and morphology. Typical assessment methods are MicroCT, which allows for acquiring images of the whole organ while lacking resolution for fine details, and confocal laser scanning microscopy, which allows detailed insights into fine structures while lacking the broader context. Imaging of histological serial whole slide sections is a recent technology able to fill this gap, since it provides a fine resolution up to the cellular level, but on a whole organ scale. However, whole slide imaging is a modality providing only 2D images. Therefore the challenge is to use stacks of serial sections from which to reconstruct the 3D vessel structures. In this paper we present a semi-automatic procedure to achieve this goal. We employ an automatic method that detects vessel structures based on continuity and shape characteristics. Furthermore it supports the user to perform manual corrections where required. With our methods we were able to successfully extract and reconstruct vessel structures from a stack of 100 and a stack of 397 serial sections of a mouse liver lobe, thus proving the potential of our approach.',\n",

Accordingly, activation of the major cellular antioxidant network correlates with increased malignancy in many cancers. This report shows that genetic co-disruption of the two major reductase systems within this network in mouse liver increases oxidative stress yet is apparently neither carcinogenic nor tumoricidal. Instead, chronic lifetime oxidative stress in the liver strongly augments the malignant progression of chemically induced cancers. Thus, the balance between oxidative stress and the endogenous antioxidant network is shown to have a much greater impact on determining malignant progression of cancers than on determining rates of cancer initiation.',\n",

Loss of LKB1 function resulted in hyperglycemia with increased gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. In LKB1-deficient livers, TORC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), was dephosphorylated and entered the nucleus, driving the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator 1Î± (PGC-1Î±), which in turn drives gluconeogenesis. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TORC2 reduced PGC-1Î± expression and normalized blood glucose levels in mice with deleted liver LKB1, indicating that TORC2 is a critical target of LKB1/AMPK signals in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.

The effects of amifostine on human basal metabolism, mouse liver metabolism and on normal and tumor hepatic cells were studied. Indirect calorimetric canopy tests showed significant reductions in oxygen consumption and of carbon dioxide emission in cancer patients receiving amifostine. Glucose levels significantly decreased and lactate levels increased in patient venous blood. Although amifostine in vitro did not inhibit the activity of the prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2, experiments with mouse liver showed that on a short timescale WR-1065 induced expression of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor HIF1Î±, lactate dehydrogenase LDH5, glucose transporter GLUT2, phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase pPDH and PDH-kinase. This effect was confirmed on normal mouse NCTC hepatocytes, but not on hepatoma cells. A sharp reduction of acetyl-CoA and ATP levels in NCTC cells indicated reduced mitochondrial usage of pyruvate. Transient changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species ROS production were evident. Amifostine selectively protects NCTC cells against radiation, whilst HepG2 neoplastic cells are sensitized. The radiation protection was correlates with HIF levels. These findings shed new light on the mechanism of amifostine cytoprotection and encourage clinical research with this agent for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer.',\n",

Method: Kung-Ming female mice were divided into six groups, each composed of twelve animals: control group, two irradiation groups, and two NAC-treated groups, as well as NAC alone-treated group. An acute study was carried out to determine alterations in the oxidative stress (malondialdehyde level) using with colorimetric method and cell apoptosis measuring by flow cytometry as well as DNA-single strand break analyzing by comet assay at 2h after irradiation in mouse liver. Results: Compared with respective irradiation group, NAC can significantly ameliorate injury induced by two types of ionizing irradiation, which marked by the decrease of malondialdehyde level, and the reduction of apoptosis cells percentage and DNA damage. But the greater efficacy of NAC was prominently observed to inhibit the damage induced by X-rays, suggesting that NAC-mediated protective effect is more advisable to X-rays than 12C6+ ion irradiation. Moreover, NAC treatment alone did not result in any damage as compared to the control group. Conclusion: NAC may merit development as a potential radioprotective agent. Furthermore, NAC might exert its best effort to respond X rays-caused damage.',\n",

Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) exchanges ADP/ATP through the mitochondrial inner membrane, and Ant2 is the predominant isoform expressed in the liver. Here we demonstrate that targeted disruption of Ant2 in mouse liver enhances uncoupled respiration without damaging mitochondrial integrity and liver functions. Interestingly, liver specific Ant2 knockout mice are leaner and resistant to hepatic steatosis, obesity and insulin resistance under a lipogenic diet. Protection against fatty liver is partially recapitulated by the systemic administration of low-dose carboxyatractyloside, a specific inhibitor of ANT. Targeted manipulation of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism, particularly through inhibition of ANT, may represent an alternative approach in NAFLD and obesity treatment.',\n",

Multivariate statistical modeling of the spectra shows that the genetic predisposition of the 129S6 mouse to impaired glucose homeostasis and NAFLD is associated with disruptions of choline metabolism, i.e., low circulating levels of plasma phosphatidylcholine and high urinary excretion of methylamines (dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide), coprocessed by symbiotic gut microbiota and mammalian enzyme systems. Conversion of choline into methylamines by microbiota in strain 129S6 on a high-fat diet reduces the bioavailability of choline and mimics the effect of choline-deficient diets, causing NAFLD. These data also indicate that gut microbiota may play an active role in the development of insulin resistance.',\n",

Since excessive dietary sugar intake may be an initiating factor for NAFLD, we have characterized the metabolic effects of liquid sucrose intake at concentrations relevant to typical human consumption in mice. We report that sucrose intake induces sexually dimorphic effects in liver, adipose tissue, and the microbiome; differences concordant with steatosis severity. We show that when steatosis is decoupled from impairments in insulin responsiveness, sex is a moderating factor that influences sucrose-driven lipid storage and the contribution of de novo fatty acid synthesis to the overall hepatic triglyceride pool. Our findings provide physiologic insight into how sex influences the regulation of adipose-liver crosstalk and highlight the importance of extrahepatic metabolism in the pathogenesis of diet-induced steatosis and NAFLD.',\n",

Furthermore, TCDD reprograms hepatic metabolism by redirecting glycolytic intermediates while inhibiting lipid metabolism. Here, we examined the effect of TCDD on hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and Î²-hydroxybutyrate levels as well as protein acetylation and Î²-hydroxybutyrylation. Acetyl-CoA is not only a central metabolite in multiple anabolic and catabolic pathways, but also a substrate used for posttranslational modification of proteins and a surrogate indicator of cellular energy status. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed a dose-dependent decrease in hepatic acetyl-CoA levels coincident with the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), and the induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, while repressing ATP citrate lyase and short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase gene expression. In addition, TCDD dose-dependently reduced the levels of hepatic Î²-hydroxybutyrate and repressed ketone body biosynthesis gene expression. Moreover, levels of total hepatic protein acetylation and Î²-hydroxybutyrylation were reduced. AMPK phosphorylation was induced consistent with acetyl-CoA serving as a cellular energy status surrogate, yet subsequent targets associated with re-establishing energy homeostasis were not activated. Collectively, TCDD reduced hepatic acetyl-CoA and Î²-hydroxybutyrate levels eliciting starvation-like conditions despite normal levels of food intake.',\n",

E2F1 activity is regulated by proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, the deubiquitylase that controls E2F1 ubiquitylation and stability remains undefined. Here we demonstrate that the deubiquitylase POH1 stabilizes E2F1 protein through binding to and deubiquitylating E2F1. Conditional knockout of Poh1 alleles results in reduced E2F1 expression in primary mouse liver cells. The POH1-mediated regulation of E2F1 expression strengthens E2F1-downstream prosurvival signals, including upregulation of Survivin and FOXM1 protein levels, and efficiently facilitates tumour growth of liver cancer cells in nude mice. Importantly, human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) recapitulate POH1 regulation of E2F1 expression, as nuclear abundance of POH1 is increased in HCCs and correlates with E2F1 overexpression and tumour growth. Thus, our study suggests that the hyperactivated POH1-E2F1 regulation may contribute to the development of liver cancer.',\n",

Delivery of VEGF-A increased liver mass in mice but did not stimulate growth of hepatocytes in vitro, unless LSECs were also present in the culture. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was identified as one of the LSEC-derived paracrine mediators promoting hepatocyte growth.

       "    'abstract': 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders.',\n",

The purified protein (Mr 71,000) supported adhesion of mouse and human cells in an Arg-Gly-Asp-dependent manner and bound to type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor with kinetics similar to those observed using human and bovine Vn. To further characterize murine Vn and its biosynthesis in vivo, a mouse Vn cDNA was isolated from a liver cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of mouse Vn was deduced from the cDNA and was aligned with that of human Vn. Based on this alignment, mouse Vn was inferred to be 457 amino acids long and to have extensive (82%) homology with human Vn. Northern blot hybridization analysis of RNA from mouse tissues, using the mouse Vn cDNA as a hybridization probe, revealed the presence of a single transcript of 1.7 kilobases in mouse liver. Vn mRNA was not detectable in heart, lung, kidney, spleen, muscle, brain, thymus, testes, uterus, skin, adipose tissue, and aorta. The cellular localization of liver Vn mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization.

Statistical copolymers combining multiple phosphonic acid groups and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were synthesized and used as coating agents for 10 nm iron oxide nanocrystals. In vitro, protein corona and stability assays show that phosphonic acid PEG copolymers outperform all other coating types examined, including low molecular weight anionic ligands and polymers. In vivo, the particle pharmacokinetics is investigated by monitoring the MRI signal intensity from mouse liver, spleen and arteries as a function of the time, between one minute and seven days after injection. Iron oxide particles coated with multi-phosphonic acid PEG polymers are shown to have a blood circulation lifetime of 250 minutes, i.e. 10 to 50 times greater than that of recently published PEGylated probes and benchmarks. The clearance from the liver takes in average 2 to 3 days and is independent of the core size, coating and particle stability. By comparing identical core particles with different coatings, we are able to determine the optimum conditions for stealth MRI probes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We have previously shown that chronic activation of mitogenic signaling induced by over-expression of c-myc and transforming growth factor-Î± (TGFÎ±) transgenes in mouse liver induces a state of oxidative stress. We therefore proposed that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation might be responsible for the extensive chromosomal damage and acceleration of hepatocarcinogenesis characteristic for TGFÎ±/c-myc mice. In this study, we show that vitamin E (VE), a potent free radical scavenging antioxidant, is able to protect liver tissue against oxidative stress and suppress tumorigenic potential of c-myc oncogene. Dietary supplementation with VE, starting from weaning, decreased ROS generation coincident with a marked inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation while increasing the chromosomal as well as mtDNA stability in the liver. Similarly, dietary VE reduced liver dysplasia and increased viability of hepatocytes. At 6 mo of age, VE treatment decreased the incidence of adenomas by 65% and prevented malignant conversion. These results indicate that ROS generated by over-expression of c-myc and TGFÎ± in the liver are the primary carcinogenic agents in this animal model. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that dietary supplementation of VE can effectively inhibit liver cancer development.',\n",

In mouse and human cells, miR-33 inhibits the expression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, thereby attenuating cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1. In mouse macrophages, miR-33 also targets ABCG1, reducing cholesterol efflux to nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Lentiviral delivery of miR-33 to mice represses ABCA1 expression in the liver, reducing circulating HDL levels. Conversely, silencing of miR-33 in vivo increases hepatic expression of ABCA1 and plasma HDL levels. Thus, miR-33 appears to regulate both HDL biogenesis in the liver and cellular cholesterol efflux.',\n",

However, the typical formalin-fixation, paraffin-embedding (FFPE) process is laborious and time consuming, often limiting its usage in time-sensitive applications such as surgical margin assessment. To address these challenges, we combine an emerging 3D quantitative phase imaging technology, termed quantitative oblique back illumination microscopy (qOBM), with an unsupervised generative adversarial network pipeline to map qOBM phase images of unaltered thick tissues (i.e., label- and slide-free) to virtually stained H&amp;E-like (vH&amp;E) images. We demonstrate that the approach achieves high-fidelity conversions to H&amp;E with subcellular detail using fresh tissue specimens from mouse liver, rat gliosarcoma, and human gliomas. We also show that the framework directly enables additional capabilities such as H&amp;E-like contrast for volumetric imaging. The quality and fidelity of the vH&amp;E images are validated using both a neural network classifier trained on real H&amp;E images and tested on virtual H&amp;E images, and a user study with neuropathologists. Given its simple and low-cost embodiment and ability to provide real-time feedback in vivo, this deep-learning-enabled qOBM approach could enable new workflows for histopathology with the potential to significantly save time, labor, and costs in cancer screening, detection, treatment guidance, and more.',\n",

Although returning hepatocytes to the liver itself would be advantageous, the feasibility of this approach has never been evaluated due to the inability to distinguish donor from host hepatocytes. To unambiguously identify transplanted hepatocytes after transplantation, and to better quantitate their number and degree of liver function, two transgenic mouse lines were generated in a C57BL/6 background. The first expresses the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene from the relatively liver-specific human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter and allows transgenic hepatocytes to be readily identified after 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside staining; the second produces the hAAT protein under control of the same promoter, which enables hepatocyte survival and maintenance of liver function to be quantitated by measuring the serum levels of hAAT. Hepatocytes isolated from transgenic donors were transplanted into nontransgenic C57BL/6 recipients by intrasplenic injection. Surprisingly, a large fraction of these cells were identified within the liver parenchyma but not the spleen at 2 months after transplantation. The high levels of serum hAAT detected in transplant recipients were stable for greater than 6 months, suggesting that established cells will survive indefinitely. These results have important implications for liver organogenesis and hepatic gene therapy.',\n",

In the world, there are many peoples suffers from liver injury and dis-ease, especially in Asia, but serious shortage of donor organ, especially for organic pathological changes, is a big problem in the world. Stem cells have the capabilities to self-renew and differ-entiate into multiple lineages, and are very significant in both theoretical research and clinical applications. Compared with traditional cell culture, cells of 3D growth are more close to their situation in vivo. The specific physics environment in space provides a great opportunity for 3D growth of cells and tissues. Due to the chance for entering into the space is so scarce, to mimic microgravity effects using a rotating cell culture system (RCCS) designed by NASA, and some other methods were studied for cellular 3D growth in vitro. Neonatal mouse liver Cells, hepatic progenitor/stem cells from fetal liver and WB-F344 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12 supplemented with 10 % FCS and several factors, and seeded into the RCCS, 6-well and 24-well plates. Their growth characteristic, metabolism, differentiation and gene expression were studied by SEM, Histochemistry, Flow Cytometry, RT-PCR and so on. The results showed: 1. Neonatal mouse liver Cells (1day after birth) seem easy to grow for a three-dimentional-like structure, when the cells were cultured in the RCCS, a cell aggregate formed after 1 day of culture and were kept during 10 days culture. The size of aggregate was about 1 2 mm in diameter. 2. Hepatic progenitor/stem cells from fetal liver seem a good cell resource for liver disease'cell therapy. They expressed AFP and CKs, and no mature hepato-cytes marker and bile duct epithelial cells marker were detected. When were transplanted into Nod-Scid mice, they had multi-potential differentiation. 3. WB-F344 cells, a liver epithelial cell line, could grew well on Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads, and expressed OV6 at a higher level and Cykt-18 and Cykt-19 at a lower level, but no Cykt-7 and Cykt-8. They are easy to get a large amount of cells, and could be thought as a convenient cell resource. The experiments are going on, and their differentiation and 3D growth are being studied.\",\n",

Sporozoites productively infected hepatocytes with high EphA2 expression, and the deletion of EphA2 protected mice from liver infection. Lack of host EphA2 phenocopied the lack of the sporozoite proteins P52 and P36.

Here we employ a novel Cre-transgenic mouse that marks 99% of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a liver-specific pericyte population, to demonstrate that HSCs give rise to 82-96% of myofibroblasts in models of toxic, cholestatic and fatty liver disease.

We developed an embryo tissue explant system that permits liver bud vasculogenesis and show that in the absence of endothelial cells, or when the latter are inhibited, there is a selective defect in hepatic outgrowth.

       "    'abstract': 'Genetic analysis in mice has demonstrated a crucial role of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), in development of the liver, muscle, and placenta. Here, we use conditional mutagenesis in mice to analyze the function of Met during liver regeneration, using the Mx-cre transgene to introduce the mutation in the adult. After partial hepatectomy in mice carrying the Mx-cre-induced Met mutation, regeneration of the liver is impaired. Comparison of signal transduction pathways in control and mutant livers indicates that Met and other signaling receptors cooperate to fully activate particular signaling molecules, for instance, the protein kinase Akt. However, activation of the Erk1/2 kinase during liver regeneration depends exclusively on Met. Signaling crosstalk is thus an important aspect of the regulation of liver regeneration. Analysis of cell cycle progression of hepatocytes in conditional Met mutant mice indicates a defective exit from quiescence and diminished entry into S phase. Impaired liver regeneration is accompanied by compensatory physiological responses that include prolonged up-regulation of HGF/SF and IL-6 in peripheral blood. Our data demonstrate that the HGF/SF/Met signaling system is essential not only during liver development but also for the regeneration of the organ in the adult.',\n",

In the present study, we examined the feasibility of performing four repeated liver biopsies in a spontaneous metabolic syndrome mouse model. Even though a small number of mice died accidently, most mice were able to undergo four liver biopsies without significant adverse events. We also performed three liver biopsies in mouse liver tumor carcinogen models at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age. In addition to the sample collected at 16 weeks of age during sacrifice, we successfully collected four liver samples from the same mice at different stages of disease progression.

Comparison of the performance characteristics of the prophageâinduction and Salmonella assays to rodent carcinogenicity assays showed that the prophageâinduction assay had a somewhat higher specificity than did the Salmonella assay (70% vs. 50%); sensitivity, concordance, and positive and negative predictivity were similar for the two microbial assays.

Ectopically expressing HNF4A remodels chromatin landscape and nucleates distinct tissue-specific BMAL1 chromatin binding events, predominantly in enhancer regions. Circadian rhythms are disturbed in Hnf4a knockout liver and HNF4A-MODY diabetic model cells. Additionally, the epigenetic state and accessibility of the liver genome dynamically change throughout the day, synchronized with chromatin occupancy of HNF4A and clustered expression of circadian outputs. Lastly, Bmal1 knockout attenuates HNF4A genome-wide binding in the liver, likely due to downregulated Hnf4a transcription.

The function of these low abundant hypermodified RNA nucleosides remains unknown. While the structure of galQ was elucidated and confirmed by total synthesis, the reported structure of manQ still awaits confirmation. By combining total synthesis and LC-MS-co-injection experiments, together with a metabolic feeding study of labelled hexoses, we show here that the natural compound manQ isolated from mouse liver deviates from the literature-reported structure. Our data show that manQ features an Î±-allyl connectivity of its sugar moiety. The yet unidentified glycosylases that attach galactose and mannose to the Q-base therefore have a maximally different constitutional connectivity preference.

The serine-threonine kinase Akt (PKB) is a principal target of insulin signaling that inhibits hepatic glucose output when glucose is available from food. Here we show that TRB3, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila tribbles, functions as a negative modulator of Akt. TRB3 expression is induced in liver under fasting conditions, and TRB3 disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to Akt and blocking activation of the kinase. Amounts of TRB3 RNA and protein were increased in livers of db/db diabetic mice compared with those in wild-type mice. Hepatic overexpression of TRB3 in amounts comparable to those in db/db mice promoted hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.

       "    'abstract': 'Polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) as an issue of global environmental concern, have been shown to induce hepatic toxicity via triggering oxidative injury and inflammation. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is initiated when excessive lipid is accumulated in the liver and will proceed to liver fibrosis with repeatedly chronic liver injury. In this study, we examined whether intravenous injection of PS-NPs could enhance the hepatic toxicity and potentiate the development of liver fibrosis in experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced mice. The results demonstrated that PS-NPs could aggravate chronic hepatitis by interfere with liver lipid metabolism in HFD induced mice. Further, hepatic tissue in PS-NPs treated HFD mice displayed substantially lowered superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which confirming the oxidative stress induced by PS-NPs. PS-NPs exposure also resulted in the up-regulation of inflammation response in liver, as evidenced by the enhanced infiltration of Kupffer cells (KCs) and elevated expression of pro-inflammatory related indicators. Meanwhile, Masson trichrome staining revealed that PS-NPs could aggravate steatohepatitis with higher collagen fiber in HFD fed mice. Our data suggests that PS-NPs can induce oxidative stress and inflammation in HDF-induced experimental mice and further aggravate liver fibrosis, which highlight the potential health risks of PS-NPs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': '2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), which is a plant auxin analogue, is lethal to broad leaved weeds within days at high dosages and is considered as having low toxicity to mammals. Some studies have reported that exposure to this compound may cause damage to organs such as liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 2,4-D in mouse liver on chromosomes as well as hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) which are required for the generation of the pyridine nucleotide pool. The experiments were carried out with a 2,4-D group, an ethanol control for 2,4-D, and saline group for ethanol control group on three generations of mice. Only female parents were given 2,4-D during the gestation period, lactation period and for 33 days following the lactation period. In females of the first cross, 2,4-D caused a significant increase in the activity of LDH, and ethanol alone caused a significant increase in the activities of HK and LDH. In the male offspring of the first cross maternal, 2,4-D caused a significant increase in the activity of LDH, and ethanol alone caused a significant decrease in the activity of 6PGD. In the female offspring of the first cross maternal, ethanol caused a significant increase in the activities of G6PD and MDH. In the female offsprings of the third cross maternal, 2,4-D caused a significant increase in the activity of MDH. No gross morphological changes were observed in internal organs, such as liver, kidney and spleen of the affected animals. Also, a chromosomal study from bone marrow cells indicated no anomalies in chromosomal sets and structures. As a result, 2,4-D had an effect on the first cross maternal and their offsprings. The compound did not affect the parameters studied except MDH enzyme activity in the second and third generation of mice.',\n",

We recently observed that neonatal ABP exposure produced liver tumors in male but not in female mice, and that NAT deficiency reduced liver tumor incidence. However, ABPâinduced liver tumor incidence did not correlate with liver levels of Nâ(deoxyguanosinâ8âyl)âABP adducts 24 hr after exposure. In this study, we compared in vivo ABPâinduced DNA mutant frequencies and spectra between male and female wildâtype and NATâdeficient Mutaâ¢Mouse using both the tumorâinducing neonatal exposure protocol and a 28âday repetitive dosing adult exposure protocol. ABP produced an increase in liver DNA mutant frequencies in both neonates and adults. However, we observed no sex or strain differences in mutant frequencies in neonatally exposed mice, and higher frequencies in adult females than males. Neonatal ABP exposure of wildâtype mice increased the proportion of GâT transversions in both males and females, while exposure of Nat1/2(â/â) mice produced increased GâT transversions in males and a decrease in females, even though females had higher levels of Nâ(deoxyguanosinâ8âyl)â4âABP adducts. There was no correlation of mutant frequencies or spectra between mice dosed as neonates or as adults. These results suggest that observed sexâ and NATâdependent differences in ABPâinduced liver tumor incidence in mice are not due to differences in either mutation rates or mutational spectra, and that mechanisms independent of carcinogen bioactivation, covalent DNA binding and mutation may be responsible for these differences.

Therefore, searching for alternative medicine, such as herbal remedies, is important. This study focused on the pathophysiology of the livers of mice infected intraperitoneally with Plasmodium berghei and the efficacy of ethanol extract from breadfruit peel. Fifty male DDY mice weighing 25 and 35 grams were placed into five treatment groups. The treatment group was infected with P. berghei and administered with breadfruit peel extract at 100 mg/kg: 200 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg, respectively, for P1, P2, and P3, P4 treated with 100 mg/kg of Doxycycline and the P5 group received no therapy. After one and two weeks, five mice from each group terminated, and then Histopathological of the liver organs were observed and scored microscopically. The results indicated that Plasmodium infection produced varied degrees of liver damage in mice. The liver's gross pathology revealed hepatomegaly, a deeper hue than normal animal liver, and flattened edges. After two weeks of infection, histopathological examination revealed that breadfruit extract could lower the amount of Plasmodium in the liver, as indicated by decreased hemozoin, and the l iver in the healing process.\",\n",

We refer to the marker genes to identify senescent cells in tissues as \"age-associated genes\". In this study, we searched for age-associated genes to identify senescent cells in the livers of aged animals. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to screen candidates for age-associated genes using young and aged rat primary hepatocytes. To remove animal species specificity, gene expression analyses in mouse livers were performed, confirming age-associated increases in the mRNA expression levels of Glipr1, Clec12a, and Phlda3. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of Glipr1 and Phlda3 were increased by stress-induced premature senescence using doxorubicin in primary hepatocytes and livers of young mice. Transcriptome data of aged rat hepatocytes suggested that Glipr1, Clec12a, and Phlda3 were expressed in almost identical cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the presence of cells with abundant Glipr1, Clec12a, and Phlda3 mRNA in 27-month-old mouse primary hepatocytes, which are considered to be senescent cells.

Okadaic acid (OA) is a similar phosphatase inhibitor, which has less affinity to PP1 than PP2A. MCLR and OA behave similarly with primary culture hepatocytes with the induction of phosphorylation of the cytokeratins, morphological changes, and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo relationship between the protein phosphatase inhibitory activities and the acute hepatotoxicity of MCLR compared to OA. MCLR and OA were intraperitoneally administrated to mice at â¼220 Î¼g/kg. After 30 min, the liver of only the MCLRâtreated mouse was darkâcolored and heavier than that of the control mouse. Subsequently, the phosphoproteins of the mouse liver were chemically modified with reversible biotinylation reagent and selectively analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Consequently, the phosphorylated Ser 354 of formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, which is an abundant enzyme in the liver cytoplasm, was observed in the MCLRâ and the OAâtreated mice 9.5 and 5.3 times more intensely than in the control mouse respectively, suggesting that MCLR and OA inhibited PP2A and induced the resulting phosphorylation. These results supported the hypothesis that the acute hepatotoxicity is possibly caused by the PP1 inhibition, and not by the PP2A inhibition.',\n",

YAP (a homolog of Drosophila Yorkie and target of the Hippo pathway) was recently implicated in control of organ size, epithelial tissue development, and tumorigenesis in mammals. However, the role of the mammalian Hippo pathway in such regulation has remained unclear. We now show that mice with liver-specific ablation of WW45 (a homolog of Drosophila Salvador and adaptor for the Hippo kinase) manifest increased liver size and expansion of hepatic progenitor cells (oval cells) and eventually develop hepatomas. Moreover, ablation of WW45 increased the abundance of YAP and induced its localization to the nucleus in oval cells, likely accounting for their increased proliferative capacity, but not in hepatocytes. Liver tumors that developed in mice heterozygous for WW45 deletion or with liver-specific WW45 ablation showed a mixed pathology combining characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and seemed to originate from oval cells. Together, our results suggest that the mammalian Hippo-Salvador pathway restricts the proliferation of hepatic oval cells and thereby controls liver size and prevents the development of oval cell-derived tumors.',\n",

HS-173 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of HSCs and induced the arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis in HSCs. Furthermore, it reduced the expression of extracellular matrix components such as collagen type I, which was confirmed by an in vivo study. We also observed that HS-173 blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, HS-173 suppressed fibrotic responses such as cell proliferation and collagen synthesis by blocking PI3K/Akt signaling.

       "    'abstract': 'The toxicology of the cyanobacterial alkaloid cylindrospermopsin (CYN), a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, appears complex and is not well understood. In exposed mice the liver is the main target for the toxic effects of CYN. In this study primary mouse hepatocyte cultures were used to investigate the mechanisms involved in CYN toxicity. The results show that 1â5 Î¼M CYN caused significant concentrationâdependent cytotoxicity (52%â82% cell death) at 18 h. Protein synthesis inhibition was a sensitive, early indicator of cellular responses to CYN. Following removal of the toxin, the inhibition of protein synthesis could not be reversed, showing behavior similar to that of the irreversible inhibitor emetine. In contrast to the LDH leakage, protein synthesis was maximally inhibited by 0.5 Î¼M CYN. No protein synthesis occurred over 4â18 h at or above this concentration. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity with 50 Î¼M proadifen or 50 Î¼M ketoconazole diminished the toxicity of CYN but not the effects on protein synthesis. These findings imply a dissociation of the two events and implicate the involvement of CYP450âderived metabolites in the toxicity process, but not in the impairment of protein synthesis. Thus, the total abolition of protein synthesis may exaggerate the metabolite effects but cannot be considered a primary cause of cell death in hepatocytes over an acute time frame. In cell types deficient in CYP450 enzymes, protein synthesis inhibition may play a more crucial role in the development of cytotoxicity.',\n",

Because homozygous null mice for either hgf/sf or c-met die in utero, we used Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting to investigate the function of c-met specifically in the adult liver. Loss of c-met appeared not to be detrimental to hepatocyte function under physiological conditions. Nonetheless, the adaptive responses of the liver to injury were dramatically affected. Mice lacking c-met gene in hepatocytes were hypersensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. When injected with a low dose of anti-Fas antibody, the majority of these mice died from massive apoptosis and hemorrhagic necrosis, whereas all wild-type mice survived with signs of minor injury. After a challenge with a single necrogenic dose of CCl<SUB>4</SUB>, c-met conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired recovery from centrolobular lesions rather than a deficit in hepatocyte proliferation. The delayed healing was associated with a persistent inflammatory reaction, over-production of osteopontin, early and prominent dystrophic calcification, and impaired hepatocyte scattering/migration into diseased areas. These studies provide direct genetic evidence in support of the critical role of c-met in efficient liver regeneration and suggest that disruption of c-met affects primarily hepatocyte survival and tissue remodeling.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Primitive erythroid cells (EryP) are the earliest differentiated cell type of the mammalian embryo. They appear in the yolk sac by embryonic day 7.5, begin to enter the embryonic circulation 2 days later and continue to mature in a stepwise and synchronous fashion. Like their adult counterparts, EryP enucleate. However, EryP circulate throughout the embryo for several days before the first enucleated forms can be identified in the blood. We have used transgenic mouse lines in which GFP marks EryP to investigate this seemingly long lag and have identified a previously unrecognized developmental niche for EryP maturation. After exiting the yolk sac, EryP begin to express cell adhesion proteins, including Î±4, Î±5, and Î²1 integrins, on their surface and migrate into the fetal liver (FL), where they interact with macrophages within erythroblastic islands. Binding of EryP to FL macrophages in vitro is stage-specific and partly depends on VCAM-1. The ability to tag and track EryP nuclei using a transgenic mouse line expressing an H2B-EGFP fusion allowed us to identify and characterize extruded EryP nuclei and to demonstrate that molecules such as Î±4, Î±5, and Î²1 integrins are redistributed onto the plasma membrane surrounding the extruding nucleus. FL macrophages engulf extruded EryP nuclei in cocultures and in the native FL in vivo. We conclude that EryP home to, complete their maturation, and enucleate within the FL, a tissue that is just developing as EryP begin to circulate. Our observations suggest a simple solution for a puzzling aspect of the development of the primitive erythroid lineage.',\n",

We have isolated and determined the sequence of a cDNA encoding 285 amino acids and the entire 3' untranslated region of 112 nucleotides of mouse apo E. The remaining coding sequence was determined by sequencing mouse liver mRNA. Comparisons with rat and human apo E sequences showed a high degree of conservation although there were regions in each species that were characterized by unique insertions and deletions. Analysis of the sequence homologies within apo E revealed that the entire sequence is made up of repetitive units. The most primitive unit appeared to be an 11-nucleotide repeat within higher order repeats of 22 or 33 nucleotides. The 11-nucleotide unit -TCGGACGAGGC- is read in all three reading frames, and when tandemly repeated, it encodes the highly conserved amino acid sequence Xaa-(Glu/Asp)-(Glu/Asp)-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Arg-Leu-Gly-Xaa-Xaa.

Several differentially hybridizing plasmids were shown to contain UCP cDNA sequences by their ability to select a mRNA coding for an in vitro translation product that was immunoprecipitable with antibodies against UCP. Blot hybridization of brown fat mRNA to a 32P-labeled UCP cDNA probe revealed two major species of mRNA (15S and 18S).

The full circadian rhythm orchestration of gene expression in the human brain and its inherent associations with AD remain largely unknown. We present a novel comprehensive approach, PRIME, to detect and analyze rhythmic oscillation patterns in untimed high-dimensional gene expression data across multiple datasets. To demonstrate the utility of PRIME, firstly, we validate it by a time course expression dataset from mouse liver as a cross-species and cross-organ validation. Then, we apply it to study oscillation patterns in untimed genome-wide gene expression from 19 human brain regions of controls and AD patients. Our findings reveal clear, synchronized oscillation patterns in 15 pairs of brain regions of control, while these oscillation patterns either disappear or dim for AD. It is worth noting that PRIME discovers the circadian rhythmic patterns without requiring the sample's timestamps.

In addition to an identical distribution in adult hepatocytes, OAT and GS have very similar expression patterns in fetal and neonatal liver. As was earlier described for GS, there is a low level of OAT mRNA in fetal cells and increasing pericentral levels in neonates that reach adult patterns within 2 weeks. These results suggest that the transcriptional regulation of the two genes is similar in the liver. However, there was a lack of colocalization of the mRNAs for the two enzymes in cells of the kidney, intestine, and brain, suggesting different regulatory decisions for the OAT and GS genes in the cells of these different tissues. The metabolic consequences of these localized expression patterns favor ammonia clearance from the blood by the liver and urea synthesis by the kidney.',\n",

Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in the regulation of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) and the development of pharmacological interventions for improved liver regeneration after PHx. We show that autophagy was activated in the early stages of liver regeneration following 70% PHx in vivo. Moreover, amiodarone was associated with a significant enhancement of autophagy, liver growth, and hepatocyte proliferation, along with reduced liver injury and the termination of liver regeneration due to decreased transforming growth factor-Î²1 expression after 70% PHx. The promotion of autophagy appeared to selectively increase the removal of damaged mitochondria. We also found that Atg7 knockdown or pretreatment with chloroquine aggravated the liver injury associated with 70% PHx and reduced liver growth and hepatocyte proliferation. Finally, amiodarone improved liver regeneration, survival, and liver injury after 90% PHx. In conclusion, our results indicate that autophagy plays an important role in mouse liver regeneration and that modulating autophagy with amiodarone may be an effective method of improving liver regeneration, increasing survival, and ameliorating liver injury following PHx.',\n",

Most increases in gene expressions, including FGF21, were targets for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), but not for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î±. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ATF4 significantly reduced Î²-conglycinin-induced increases in hepatic FGF21 gene expression. In FGF21-deficient mice, Î²-conglycinin effects were partially abolished.

Progenitors with macrophage potential in vitro have been described in the yolk sac before emergence of HSCs, and fetal macrophages can develop independently of Myb, a transcription factor required for HSC, and can persist in adult tissues. Nevertheless, the origin of adult macrophages and the qualitative and quantitative contributions of HSC and putative non-HSC-derived progenitors are still unclear. Here we show in mice that the vast majority of adult tissue-resident macrophages in liver (Kupffer cells), brain (microglia), epidermis (Langerhans cells) and lung (alveolar macrophages) originate from a Tie2<SUP>+</SUP> (also known as Tek) cellular pathway generating Csf1r<SUP>+</SUP> erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) distinct from HSCs. EMPs develop in the yolk sac at embryonic day (E) 8.5, migrate and colonize the nascent fetal liver before E10.5, and give rise to fetal erythrocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and monocytes until at least E16.5. Subsequently, HSC-derived cells replace erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. Kupffer cells, microglia and Langerhans cells are only marginally replaced in one-year-old mice, whereas alveolar macrophages may be progressively replaced in ageing mice. Our fate-mapping experiments identify, in the fetal liver, a sequence of yolk sac EMP-derived and HSC-derived haematopoiesis, and identify yolk sac EMPs as a common origin for tissue macrophages.',\n",

In addition to this local action, IGF1 secreted by the liver and circulating in the plasma presumably acts systemically as a classical hormone. However, an endocrine role of IGF1 in growth control was disputed on the basis of the results of a conditional, liver-specific Igf1 gene knockout in mice, which reduced significantly the level of serum IGF1, but did not affect average body weight. Because alternate interpretations of these negative data were tenable, we addressed genetically the question of hormonal IGF1 action by using a positive experimental strategy based on the features of the cre/loxP recombination system. Thus, we generated bitransgenic mice carrying in an Igf1 null background a dormant Igf1 cDNA placed downstream of a transcriptional \"stop\" DNA sequence flanked by loxP sites (floxed) and also a cre transgene driven by a liver-specific promoter. The Igf1 cDNA, which was inserted by knock-in into the mutated and inactive Igf1 locus itself to ensure proper transcriptional regulation, was conditionally expressed from cognate promoters exclusively in the liver after Cre-mediated excision of the floxed block.

Deletion of fatty acid synthase or acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 in mice resulted in embryonic lethality, indicating that the de novo fatty acid synthesis is essential for embryonic development. To understand the importance of de novo fatty acid synthesis and the role of ACC1-produced malonyl-CoA in adult mouse tissues, we generated liver-specific ACC1 knockout (LACC1KO) mice. LACC1KO mice have no obvious health problem under normal feeding conditions. Total ACC activity and malonyl-CoA levels were â70-75% lower in liver of LACC1KO mice compared with that of the WT mice. In addition, the livers of LACC1KO mice accumulated 40-70% less triglycerides. Unexpectedly, when fed fat-free diet for 10 days, there was significant up-regulation of PPARÎ³ and several enzymes in the lipogenic pathway in the liver of LACC1KO mice compared with the WT mice. Despite the significant up-regulation of the lipogenic enzymes, including a &gt;2-fold increase in fatty acid synthase mRNA, protein, and activity, there was significant decrease in the de novo fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride accumulation in the liver. However, there were no significant changes in blood glucose and fasting ketone body levels. Hence, reducing cytosolic malonyl-CoA and, therefore, the de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver, does not affect fatty acid oxidation and glucose homeostasis under lipogenic conditions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Knockout studies have shown that the transcription factor Nrf1 is essential for embryonic development. Nrf1 has been implicated to play a role in mediating activation of oxidative stress response genes through the antioxidant response element (ARE). Because of embryonic lethality in knockout mice, analysis of this function in the adult knockout mouse was not possible. We report here that mice with somatic inactivation of nrf1 in the liver developed hepatic cancer. Before cancer development, mutant livers exhibited steatosis, apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. In addition, hepatocytes lacking Nrf1 showed oxidative stress, and gene expression analysis showed decreased expression of various ARE-containing genes, and up-regulation of CYP4A genes. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species generated from CYP4A-mediated fatty acid oxidation work synergistically with diminished expression of ARE-responsive genes to cause oxidative stress in mutant hepatocytes. Thus, Nrf1 has a protective function against oxidative stress and, potentially, a function in lipid homeostasis in the liver. Because the phenotype is similar to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, these animals may prove useful as a model for investigating molecular mechanisms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Ibuprofen, an inhibitor of prostanoid biosynthesis, is a common pharmacological agent used for the management of pain, inflammation and fever. However, the chronic use of ibuprofen at high doses is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and liver injuries. The underlying mechanisms of ibuprofen-mediated effects on liver remain unclear. To determine the mechanisms and signaling pathways affected by ibuprofen (100 mg/kg/day for seven days), we performed proteomic profiling of male mice liver with quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using ten-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. More than 300 proteins were significantly altered between the control and ibuprofen-treated groups. The data suggests that several major pathways including (1) energy metabolism, (2) protein degradation, (3) fatty acid metabolism and (4) antioxidant system are altered in livers from ibuprofen treated mice. Independent validation of protein changes in energy metabolism and the antioxidant system was carried out by Western blotting and showed sex-related differences. Proteasome and immunoproteasome activity/expression assays showed ibuprofen induced gender-specific proteasome and immunoproteasome dysfunction in liver. The study observed multifactorial gender-specific ibuprofen-mediated effects on mice liver and suggests that males and females are affected differently by ibuprofen.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a prototype for liver-specific pathogens in which the failure of the immune system to mount an effective response leads to chronic infection. Our understanding of the immune response to HBV is incomplete, largely due to the narrow host restriction of this pathogen and the limitations of existing experimental models. We have developed a murine model for studying human HBV replication, immunogenicity, and control. After transfection of hepatocytes in vivo with a replication-competent, over-length, linear HBV genome, viral antigens and replicative intermediates were synthesized and virus was secreted into the blood. Viral antigens disappeared from the blood as early as 7 days after transfection, coincident with the appearance of antiviral antibodies. HBV transcripts and replicative intermediates disappeared from the liver by day 15, after the appearance of antiviral CD8 + T cells. In contrast, the virus persisted for at least 81 days after transfection of NOD/Scid mice, which lack functional T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Thus, the outcome of hydrodynamic transfection of HBV depends on the host immune response, as it is during a natural infection. The methods we describe will allow the examination of viral dynamics in a tightly controlled in vivo system, the application of mutagenesis methods to the study of the HBV life cycle in vivo, and the dissection of the immune response to HBV using genetically modified mice whose immunoregulatory and immune effector functions have been deleted or overexpressed. In addition, this methodology represents a prototype for the study of other known and to-be-discovered liver-specific pathogens.',\n",

Beauveriolides I and III strongly inhibited the cholesteryl ester (CE) synthesis with IC<SUB>50</SUB> values of 0.78 and 0.41 Î¼M, respectively, without showing significant effects on the triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. Furthermore, lysosomal cholesterol metabolism to CE in macrophages was inhibited by the compounds, indicating that the inhibition site lies within steps between cholesterol departure from the lysosome and CE synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in the membrane fractions prepared from mouse macrophages was studied, resulting in a dose-dependent inhibition by beauveriolides I and III with IC<SUB>50</SUB> values of 6.0 and 5.5 Î¼M, respectively. Thus, we showed that the beauveriolides inhibit macrophage ACAT activity specifically, resulting in blockage of the CE synthesis, leading to a reduction of lipid droplets in macrophages. ACAT activity in the membrane fractions prepared from mouse liver and Caco-2 cells was also inhibited, indicating that the beauveriolides block both ACAT-1 and -2. Moreover, beauveriolides I and III exert antiatherogenic activity in both low-density lipoprotein receptor- and apolipoprotein E-knockout mice without any side effects such as diarrhea or cytotoxicity to adrenal tissues as observed for many synthetic ACAT inhibitors. Beauveriolides I and III are the first microbial cyclodepsipeptides having an in vivo antiatherosclerotic effect and show promise as potential lead compounds for antiatherosclerotic agents.',\n",

Screening for production of anti-GR-antibodies by the hybridomas was carried out with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using partially purified rat liver GR as antigen. Further screening was by a second-antibody immunoprecipitation assay using [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-GR complex from rat liver cytosol as tracer. Hybridomas from 10 different microplate wells, positive in both assays, were successfully cloned by the limiting dilution method to monoclonality. The different origins of the monoclonal antibodies were confirmed by their various isoelectric points when analyzed by isoelectric focusing. Four of the monoclonal hybridoma cell lines secreted IgM antibodies; two, IgG1; three, IgG2a; and one, IgG2b. The GR-antibody complex was identified in glycerol density gradients by a shift of the 4S GR to an 8.5S or 19S GR-antibody complex when incubated with monoclonal IgG or IgM antibody, respectively. The 10 monoclonal antibodies recognized different determinants on the GR, all situated on that domain of the receptor that is separate from the ligand and DNA-binding domains. Also, the cross-reactivity to the mouse liver GR varied among the monoclonal antibodies. No cross-reactivity was observed to the human lymphocytic GR. NaDodSO4 electrophoresis of a 0.5% pure GR preparation followed by immunoblotting using one of the monoclonal antibodies identified a single peptide with a molecular weight of 94,000, identical to the purified rat liver GR.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) system is essential for cytoprotection against oxidative and electrophilic insults. Under unstressed conditions, Keap1 serves as an adaptor for ubiquitin E3 ligase and promotes proteasomal degradation of Nrf2, but Nrf2 is stabilized when Keap1 is inactivated under oxidative/electrophilic stress conditions. Autophagy-deficient mice show aberrant accumulation of p62, a multifunctional scaffold protein, and develop severe liver damage. The p62 accumulation disrupts the Keap1-Nrf2 association and provokes Nrf2 stabilization and accumulation. However, individual contributions of p62 and Nrf2 to the autophagy-deficiency-driven liver pathogenesis have not been clarified. To examine whether Nrf2 caused the liver injury independent of p62, we crossed liver-specific Atg7::Keap1-Alb double-mutant mice into p62- and Nrf2-null backgrounds. Although Atg7::Keap1-Alb::p62<SUP>-/-</SUP> triple-mutant mice displayed defective autophagy accompanied by the robust accumulation of Nrf2 and severe liver injury, Atg7::Keap1-Alb::Nrf2<SUP>-/-</SUP> triple-mutant mice did not show any signs of such hepatocellular damage. Importantly, in this study we noticed that Keap1 accumulated in the Atg7- or p62-deficient mouse livers and the Keap1 level did not change by a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that the Keap1 protein is constitutively degraded through the autophagy pathway. This finding is in clear contrast to the Nrf2 degradation through the proteasome pathway. We also found that treatment of cells with tert-butylhydroquinone accelerated the Keap1 degradation. These results thus indicate that Nrf2 accumulation is the dominant cause to provoke the liver damage in the autophagy-deficient mice. The autophagy pathway maintains the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 system for the normal liver function by governing the Keap1 turnover.',\n",

We found that HSP70 transcription is upregulated in the liver of nonhibernating (summer-active) chipmunks compared with hibernating (winter-torpid) ones. In parallel, HSF1, the major transcription factor for HSP70 expression, is abundant in the liver-cell nuclei of nonhibernating chipmunks, and disappears from the nuclei of hibernating ones. Moreover, during IBA, HSF1 reappears in the nuclei and drives HSP70 transcription. In mouse liver, HSF1 is regulated by the daily Tb rhythm, and acts as a circadian transcription factor. Taken together, chipmunks similarly use the Tb rhythm to regulate gene expression via HSF1 during the torpor-arousal cycle in the hibernation season.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Mitochondria generate ATP and play regulatory roles in various cellular activities. Cancer cells often exhibit fragmented mitochondria. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that a mitochondrial protein FUN14 domain containing 2 (FUNDC2) is transcriptionally upregulated in primary mouse liver tumors, and in approximately 40% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, elevated FUNDC2 expression inversely correlates with patient survival, and its knockdown inhibits liver tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, the amino-terminal region of FUNDC2 interacts with the GTPase domain of mitofusin 1 (MFN1), thus inhibits its activity in promoting fusion of outer mitochondrial membrane. As a result, loss of FUNDC2 leads to mitochondrial elongation, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism. These results identified a mechanism of mitochondrial fragmentation in cancer through MFN1 inhibition by FUNDC2, and suggested FUNDC2 as a potential therapeutic target of HCC.',\n",

Here we established a method to separate LD subpopulations from isolated CHO K2 LDs into three different size categories. The subpopulation with smallest LDs was nearly free of ER and other membranous structures while those with larger LDs contained intact ER. These distinct subpopulations of LDs differed in their protein composition and ability to recruit proteins. This method was also applicable to LDs obtained from other sources, such as Huh7 cells, mouse liver and brown adipose tissue, et al. We developed an in vitro assay requiring only isolated LDs, Coenzyme A, and ATP to drive lipid synthesis. The LD subpopulation nearly depleted of ER was able to incorporate fatty acids into triacylglycerol and phospholipids. Together, our data demonstrate that LDs in a given cell are heterogeneous in size and function, and suggest that LDs are one of cellular lipid synthetic organelles.',\n",

As light scatters in biological tissues, the excitation has a three-dimensional (3D) pattern allocation. Accurate reconstruction of the 3D distribution of optical absorption requires a large solid angle of detection of the ultrasonic field. Moreover, the center frequency and bandwidth of a given detector define the range of structure sizes it is able to resolve. Therefore, detectors with different frequency bandwidths record different subsets of information. A volumetric optoacoustic system using linear ultrasound arrays with different central frequencies, 6MHz and 24MHz, is introduced. By employing a novel scanning geometry that takes advantage of the high sensitivity on the transversal dimension of these linear probes, high resolution optoacoustic signals are being recorded. Resolution performance and biological capabilities are demonstrated with a 20um crossed-suture phantom and an excised mouse liver lobe.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Introduction:RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from space biology experiments promise to yield invaluable insights into the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial biology. However, sample numbers from each study are low due to limited crew availability, hardware, and space. To increase statistical power, spaceflight RNA-seq datasets from different missions are often aggregated together. However, this can introduce technical variation or \"batch effects\", often due to differences in sample handling, sample processing, and sequencing platforms. Several computational methods have been developed to correct for technical batch effects, thereby reducing their impact on true biological signals.Methods:In this study, we combined 7 mouse liver RNA-seq datasets from NASA GeneLab (part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository) to evaluate several common batch effect correction methods (ComBat and ComBat-seq from the sva R package, and Median Polish, Empirical Bayes, and ANOVA from the MBatch R package). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify library preparation method and mission as the primary sources of batch effect among the technical variables in the combined dataset. We next quantitatively evaluated the ability of each of the indicated methods to correct for each identified technical batch variable using the following criteria: BatchQC, PCA, dispersion separability criterion, log fold change correlation, and differential gene expression analysis. Each batch variable/correction method combination was then assessed using a custom scoring approach to identify the optimal correction method for the combined dataset, by geometrically probing the space of all allowable scoring functions to yield an aggregate volume-based scoring measure.Results and Discussion:Using the method described for the combined dataset in this study, the library preparation variable/ComBat correction method pair out ranked the other candidate pairs, suggesting that this combined dataset should be corrected for library preparation using the ComBat correction method prior to downstream analysis. We describe the GeneLab multi-study analysis and visualization portal which will allow users to access the publicly available space biology \\'omics data, select multiple studies to combine for analysis, and examine the presence or absence of batch effects using multiple metrics. If the user chooses to perform batch effect correction, the scoring approach described here can be implemented to identify the optimal correction method to use for their specific combined dataset prior to analysis.',\n",

In the meantime, S. boulardii induced dramatic changes in the gut microbial composition. At the phylum level, we found that S. boulardii significantly increased in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, and decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which may explain the hepatic protective effects of S. boulardii.

Hepatocytes have long been considered the only liver cells expressing SR-B1; however, in this study we describe two disparate immunofluorescence (IF) experiments that suggest otherwise. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy employing ultrathin (120\\u2009nm) sections of mouse liver, improving z-axis resolution, we identified the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), marked by FcÎ³RIIb, as the cell within the liver expressing abundant SR-B1. In contrast, the hepatocyte, identified with Î²-catenin, expressed considerably weaker levels, although optical resolution of SR-B1 was inadequate. Thus, we moved to a different IF strategy, first separating dissociated liver cells by gradient centrifugation into two portions, hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) and LSEC (non-parenchymal cells). Characterizing both portions for the cellular expression of SR-B1 by flow cytometry, we found that LSEC expressed considerable amounts of SR-B1 while in hepatocytes SR-B1 expression was barely perceptible.

       "    'abstract': 'The signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT5b, has been implicated in signal transduction pathways for a number of cytokines and growth factors, including growth hormone (GH). Pulsatile but not continuous GH exposure activates liver STAT5b by tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation of the STAT, which is proposed to play a key role in regulating the sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression induced by pulsatile plasma GH. We have evaluated the importance of STAT5b for the physiological effects of GH pulses using a mouse gene knockout model. STAT5b gene disruption led to a major loss of multiple, sexually differentiated responses associated with the sexually dimorphic pattern of pituitary GH secretion. Male-characteristic body growth rates and male-specific liver gene expression were decreased to wild-type female levels in STAT5b<SUP>-/-</SUP> males, while female-predominant liver gene products were increased to a level intermediate between wild-type male and female levels. Although these responses are similar to those observed in GH-deficient Little mice, STAT5b<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice are not GH-deficient, suggesting that they may be GH pulse-resistant. Indeed, the dwarfism, elevated plasma GH, low plasma insulin-like growth factor I, and development of obesity seen in STAT5b<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice are all characteristics of Laron-type dwarfism, a human GH-resistance disease generally associated with a defective GH receptor. The requirement of STAT5b to maintain sexual dimorphism of body growth rates and liver gene expression suggests that STAT5b may be the major, if not the sole, STAT protein that mediates the sexually dimorphic effects of GH pulses in liver and perhaps other target tissues. STAT5b thus has unique physiological functions for which, surprisingly, the highly homologous STAT5a is unable to substitute.',\n",

A micro-MRI based virtual mouse phantom was assigned appropriate tissue optical properties to each of its segmented internal organs at wavelengths spanning the emission spectrum of the firefly luciferase at 37 Â°C. The TOAST finite-element code was employed to simulate the diffuse transport of photons emitted from bioluminescence sources in the mouse. OPET measurements were simulated for single-point, two-point and distributed bioluminescence sources located in different organs such as the liver, the kidneys and the gut. An expectation maximization code was employed to recover the intensity and location of these simulated sources. It was found that spectrally resolved measurements were necessary in order to perform tomographic bioluminescence imaging. The true location of emission sources could be recovered if the mouse background optical properties were known a priori.

It is not clear, however, to what extent these systems will be useful for an analysis of the sequences necessary for tissue-specific gene expression. A more appropriate approach for such an analysis might be the production of mice that contain a cloned foreign gene in all their cells, throughout development. This could be accomplished by the transfer of a cloned gene into germ-line cells, and the subsequent transmission of that gene to offspring. Previously, SV40 DNA sequences<SUP>11</SUP> and a cloned HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene<SUP>12</SUP> have been introduced into somatic tissues of mice by microinjection of the DNAs into blastocysts<SUP>11</SUP> or eggs<SUP>12</SUP>, but germ-line transmission of these sequences has not been demonstrated. The only foreign DNA sequences which have been transferred into and transmitted by the mouse germ-line have been exogenous Moloney leukaemia virus genomes introduced by viral infection of early embryos<SUP>13</SUP>. We now report the introduction of a cloned rabbit DNA fragment containing the adult Î²-globin gene into the germ-line of mice. We have analysed 24 mice derived from eggs microinjected with this DNA.

On the basis of expression and in vitro studies, it has been proposed that the Foxa transcription factors establish competence by opening compacted chromatin structures within liver-specific target genes. Here we show that Foxa1 and Foxa2 (forkhead box proteins A1 and A2) are required in concert for hepatic specification in mouse. In embryos deficient for both genes in the foregut endoderm, no liver bud is evident and expression of the hepatoblast marker alpha-fetoprotein (Afp) is lost. Furthermore, Foxa1/Foxa2-deficient endoderm cultured in the presence of exogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) fails to initiate expression of the liver markers albumin and transthyretin. Thus, Foxa1 and Foxa2 are required for the establishment of competence within the foregut endoderm and the onset of hepatogenesis.',\n",

We report here a peculiar phenotype of Usf2<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice that progressively develop multivisceral iron overload; plasma iron overcomes transferrin binding capacity, and nontransferrin-bound iron accumulates in various tissues including pancreas and heart. In contrast, the splenic iron content is strikingly lower in knockout animals than in controls. To identify genes that may account for the abnormalities of iron homeostasis in Usf2<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice, we used suppressive subtractive hybridization between livers from Usf2<SUP>-/-</SUP> and wild-type mice. We isolated a cDNA encoding a peptide, hepcidin (also referred to as LEAP-1, for liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide), that was very recently purified from human blood ultrafiltrate and from urine as a disulfide-bonded peptide exhibiting antimicrobial activity. Accumulation of iron in the liver has been recently reported to up-regulate hepcidin expression, whereas our data clearly show that a complete defect in hepcidin expression is responsible for progressive tissue iron overload. The striking similarity of the alterations in iron metabolism between HFE knockout mice, a murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis, and the Usf2<SUP>-/-</SUP> hepcidin-deficient mice suggests that hepcidin may function in the same regulatory pathway as HFE. We propose that hepcidin acts as a signaling molecule that is required in conjunction with HFE to regulate both intestinal iron absorption and iron storage in macrophages.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The single-stranded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displacement-loop initiation sequence (7S mtDNA) is hydrogen-bonded at the origin of replication in animal cell mtDNA. Analysis of 7S mtDNA from several cell sources indicates that this initiation sequence exists as a family of fragments of relatively discrete lengths. mtDNA from both mouse L cells and mouse liver has four major sizes of 7S mtDNA fragments, ranging from 500 to 580 nucleotides in length. The 5â§-end region of each of these species is the same; thus, the size heterogeneity is due primarily to differences in length at the 3â§-end of these molecules. By contrast, 7S mtDNA from both human KB cells and human liver exists in three major forms, ranging from 555 to 615 nucleotides in length, due to differences at both terminal regions. The mtDNA initiation sequence from Xenopus laevis oocytes also exists in at least two forms, 1350 and 1510 nucleotides in length. Thus, the maintenance of multiple forms of mtDNA initiation sequence appears to be a general phenomenon of animal cells, although the precise mechanism of synthesis or processing of these forms is variable. The sequence of 42 nucleotides at the 5â§-end of 7S mtDNA from mouse L cells has been determined and found to be rich in dGuo and dThd residues, with no apparent palindromes or potential secondary structures. We thus present sequence information on the replication origin of mtDNA, as defined by the naturally occurring 7S mtDNA.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Activation of the AKT/mTOR cascade and overexpression of c-Met have been implicated in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To elucidate the functional crosstalk between the two pathways, we generated a model characterized by the combined expression of activated AKT and c-Met in the mouse liver. Co-expression of AKT and c-Met triggered rapid liver tumor development and mice required to be euthanized within 8 weeks after hydrodynamic injection. At the molecular level, liver tumors induced by AKT/c-Met display activation of AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK cascades as well as increased lipogenesis and glycolysis. Since a remarkable lipogenic phenotype characterizes liver lesions from AKT/c-Met mice, we determined the requirement of lipogenesis in AKT/c-Met driven hepatocarcinogenesis using conditional Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) knockout mice. Of note, hepatocarcinogenesis induced by AKT/c-Met was fully inhibited by FASN ablation. In human HCC samples, coordinated expression of FASN, activated AKT, and c-Met proteins was detected in a subgroup of biologically aggressive tumors. Altogether, our study demonstrates that co-activation of AKT and c-Met induces HCC development that depends on the mTORC1/FASN pathway. Suppression of mTORC1 and/or FASN might be highly detrimental for the growth of human HCC subsets characterized by concomitant induction of the AKT and c-Met cascades.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The trillions of microbes that colonize our adult intestines function collectively as a metabolic organ that communicates with, and complements, our own human metabolic apparatus. Given the worldwide epidemic in obesity, there is interest in how interactions between human and microbial metabolomes may affect our energy balance. Here we report that, in contrast to mice with a gut microbiota, germ-free (GF) animals are protected against the obesity that develops after consuming a Western-style, high-fat, sugar-rich diet. Their persistently lean phenotype is associated with increased skeletal muscle and liver levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream targets involved in fatty acid oxidation (acetylCoA carboxylase; carnitine-palmitoyltransferase). Moreover, GF knockout mice lacking fasting-induced adipose factor (Fiaf), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor whose expression is normally selectively suppressed in the gut epithelium by the microbiota, are not protected from diet-induced obesity. Although GF Fiaf-/- animals exhibit similar levels of phosphorylated AMPK as their wild-type littermates in liver and gastrocnemius muscle, they have reduced expression of genes encoding the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (Pgc-1Î±) and enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Thus, GF animals are protected from diet-induced obesity by two complementary but independent mechanisms that result in increased fatty acid metabolism: (i) elevated levels of Fiaf, which induces Pgc-1Î±; and (ii) increased AMPK activity. Together, these findings support the notion that the gut microbiota can influence both sides of the energy balance equation, and underscore the importance of considering our metabolome in a supraorganismal context.',\n",

The metabolome, which serves as a connection among transcriptome, proteome and toxic effects, provides pathway-based insights into effects of PFOA. Since understanding of changes in the metabolic profile during hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity were still incomplete, a high-throughput targeted metabolomics approach (278 metabolites) was used to investigate effects of exposure to PFOA for 28 d on brain and liver of male Balb/c mice. Results of multivariate statistical analysis indicated that PFOA caused alterations in metabolic pathways in exposed individuals. Pathway analysis suggested that PFOA affected metabolism of amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and energetics. Ten and 18 metabolites were identified as potential unique biomarkers of exposure to PFOA in brain and liver, respectively. In brain, PFOA affected concentrations of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate in brain, which provides novel insights into mechanisms of PFOA-induced neurobehavioral effects. In liver, profiles of lipids revealed involvement of Î²-oxidation and biosynthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity, while alterations in metabolism of arachidonic acid suggesting potential of PFOA to cause inflammation response in liver.

Finally, sRGNs, but not SpyCas9, could be packaged into all-in-one AAV particles with a gRNA and effected robust in vivo editing of non-human primate (NHP) retina photoreceptors. Human gene therapy efforts are expected to benefit from these improved alternatives to existing CRISPR nucleases.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Inflammatory destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts is a common cause of vanishing bile duct syndrome and cholestasis, often progressing to biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of inflammatory biliary disease are poorly understood. Here, we show that the two IÎºB kinases, IKK1/IKKÎ± and IKK2/IKKÎ², display distinct collaborative and specific functions that are essential to protect the liver from cytokine toxicity and bile duct disease. Combined conditional ablation of IKK1 and IKK2, but not of each kinase alone, sensitized the liver to in vivo LPS challenge, uncovering a redundant function of the two IÎºB kinases in mediating canonical NF-ÎºB signaling in hepatocytes and protecting the liver from TNF-induced failure. Unexpectedly, mice with combined ablation of IKK1 and IKK2 or IKK1 and NEMO spontaneously developed severe jaundice and fatal cholangitis characterized by inflammatory destruction of small portal bile ducts. This bile duct disease was caused by the combined impairment of canonical NF-ÎºB signaling together with inhibition of IKK1-specific functions affecting the bile-blood barrier. These results reveal a novel function of the two IÎºB kinases in cooperatively regulating liver immune homeostasis and bile duct integrity and suggest that IKK signaling may be implicated in human biliary diseases.',\n",

Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of 189 samples collected from 124 patients and 8 mice with liver cancer. With more than 1 million cells analysed, we stratified patients into five TIME subtypes, including immune activation, immune suppression mediated by myeloid or stromal cells, immune exclusion and immune residence phenotypes. Different TIME subtypes were spatially organized and associated with chemokine networks and genomic features. Notably, tumour-associated neutrophil (TAN) populations enriched in the myeloid-cell-enriched subtype were associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Through in vitro induction of TANs and ex vivo analyses of patient TANs, we showed that CCL4<SUP>+</SUP> TANs can recruit macrophages and that PD-L1<SUP>+</SUP> TANs can suppress T cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis of mouse neutrophil subsets revealed that they are largely conserved with those of humans. In vivo neutrophil depletion in mouse models attenuated tumour progression, confirming the pro-tumour phenotypes of TANs. With this detailed cellular heterogeneity landscape of liver cancer, our study illustrates diverse TIME subtypes, highlights immunosuppressive functions of TANs and sheds light on potential immunotherapies targeting TANs.',\n",

To test this hypothesis directly, telomerase-deficient mice, null for the essential telomerase RNA (mTR) gene, were subjected to genetic, surgical, and chemical ablation of the liver. Telomere dysfunction was associated with defects in liver regeneration and accelerated the development of liver cirrhosis in response to chronic liver injury.

To determine whether cytokines are involved in the initiation of liver growth, we studied the regeneration of the liver after partial hepatectomy (PH) in mice lacking type I tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR-I). DNA synthesis after PH was severely impaired in these animals, and the expected increases in the binding of the NF-ÎºB and STAT3 transcription factors shortly after PH failed to occur. Binding of AP-1 after PH was decreased in TNFR-I knockout mice compared with animals with the intact receptor whereas C/EBP binding was not modified. Injection of interleukin 6 in TNFR-I-deficient animals 30 min before PH corrected the defect in DNA synthesis and restored STAT3 and AP-1 binding to normal levels but had no effect on NF-ÎºB binding in the regenerating liver. The results indicate that TNF, signaling through the TNFR-I, can initiate liver regeneration and acts by activating an interleukin 6-dependent pathway that involves the STAT3 transcription factor.',\n",

The graphene oxides were prepared by the modified Hummers method and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The human fibroblast cells were cultured with different doses of graphene oxides for day 1 to day 5. Thirty mice divided into three test groups (low, middle, high dose) and one control group were injected with 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 mg graphene oxides, respectively, and were raised for 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. Results showed that the water-soluble graphene oxides were successfully prepared; graphene oxides with dose less than 20 Î¼g/mL did not exhibit toxicity to human fibroblast cells, and the dose of more than 50 Î¼g/mL exhibits obvious cytotoxicity such as decreasing cell adhesion, inducing cell apoptosis, entering into lysosomes, mitochondrion, endoplasm, and cell nucleus. Graphene oxides under low dose (0.1 mg) and middle dose (0.25 mg) did not exhibit obvious toxicity to mice and under high dose (0.4 mg) exhibited chronic toxicity, such as 4/9 mice death and lung granuloma formation, mainly located in lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, almost could not be cleaned by kidney. In conclusion, graphene oxides exhibit dose-dependent toxicity to cells and animals, such as inducing cell apoptosis and lung granuloma formation, and cannot be cleaned by kidney. When graphene oxides are explored for in vivo applications in animal or human body, its biocompatibility must be considered.\",\n",

Glycoengineering of anti-CD20mAb may contribute to increased anti-tumor efficacy through enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADP) as reported by in vitro studies. However, where and how glycoengineered Ab may potentiate therapeutic responses in vivo is yet to be elucidated. Here, we have performed mouse liver transplants to demonstrate that the liver is sufficient to mediate systemic B cells depletion after anti-CD20 treatment. Relying on intravital two-photon imaging of human CD20-expressing mice, we provide evidence that ADP by Kupffer cells (KC) is a major mechanism for rituximab-mediated B cell depletion. Notably, a glycoengineered anti-mouse CD20 Ab but not its wild-type counterpart triggered potent KC-mediated B cell depletion at low doses. Finally, distinct thresholds for KC phagocytosis were also observed for GA101 (obinutuzumab), a humanized glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 Ab and rituximab. Thus, we propose that enhanced phagocytosis of circulating B cells by KC represents an important in vivo mechanism underlying the improved activity of glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAbs.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The earliest defect in developing type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, characterized by decreased glucose transport and metabolism in muscle and adipocytes. The glucose transporter GLUT4 mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle by rapidly moving from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane. In insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, GLUT4 expression is decreased in adipose tissue but preserved in muscle. Because skeletal muscle is the main site of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, the role of adipose tissue GLUT4 downregulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes is unclear. To determine the role of adipose GLUT4 in glucose homeostasis, we used Cre/loxP DNA recombination to generate mice with adipose-selective reduction of GLUT4 (G4A<SUP>-/-</SUP>). Here we show that these mice have normal growth and adipose mass despite markedly impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. Although GLUT4 expression is preserved in muscle, these mice develop insulin resistance in muscle and liver, manifested by decreased biological responses and impaired activation of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase. G4A<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice develop glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia. Thus, downregulation of GLUT4 and glucose transport selectively in adipose tissue can cause insulin resistance and thereby increase the risk of developing diabetes.',\n",

The inserts span 4,600 nucleotides of the C3 coding sequence, including the 3' end of C3 mRNA. The length of C3 mRNA was determined to be 5,100 +/- 200 nucleotides, including a poly(A)-containing tail of mean length 170 nucleotides. From cDNA sequence analysis of the 5'-proximal region of C3 mRNA, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature C3 beta chain was predicted to be Ile-Pro-Met-Tyr-Ser-Ile-Ile-Thr-Pro-Asn-Val-Leu-Arg-Leu-Glu. This sequence is in good agreement with the reported amino acid sequences of human and guinea pig C3 beta chains. These data position the C3 beta subunit to the NH2-terminal portion of the precursor C3 molecule (pro-C3) and establish the order of subunits in pro-C3 to be NH2-beta-alpha-COOH. In addition, the cDNA sequence indicates that an NH2-terminal extension peptide precedes the beta chain in pro-C3. The amino acid sequence of the mouse C3a fragment and its flanking regions was determined. The data indicate the presence of four arginine residues located between the COOH terminus of the C3 beta and the NH2 terminus of the C3 alpha subunits in pro-C3. The coding sequences of the amino acids that constitute the internal thioester domain in C3 were determined. Unexpectedly, the glutamyl residue that has been shown to participate in the thioester bond in native C3 was found to be encoded as a glutamine.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Islet transplantation offers a potential therapy to restore glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes patients. However, islet transplantation is not routinely successful because most islet recipients gradually lose graft function. Furthermore, serological markers of islet function are insensitive to islet loss until the latter stages of islet graft rejection. A noninvasive method of monitoring islet grafts would aid in the assessment of islet graft survival and the evaluation of interventions designed to prolong graft survival. Here, we show that recombinant adenovirus can engineer isolated islets to express a positron-emission tomography (PET) reporter gene and that these islets can be repeatedly imaged by using microPET after transplantation into mice. The magnitude of signal from engineered islets implanted into the axillary cavity was directly related to the implanted islet mass. PET signals attenuated over the following weeks because of the transient nature of adenovirus-mediated gene expression. Because the liver is the preferred site for islet implantation in humans, we also tested whether islets could be imaged after transfusion into the mouse liver. Control studies revealed that both intrahepatic islet transplantation and hyperglycemia altered the biodistribution kinetics of the PET probe systemically. Although transplanted islets were dispersed throughout the liver, clear signals from the liver region of mice receiving PET reporter-expressing islets were detectable for several weeks. Viral transduction, PET reporter expression, and repeated microPET imaging had no apparent deleterious effects on islet function after implantation. These studies lay a foundation for noninvasive quantitative assessments of islet graft survival using PET. diabetes | transplantation',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of non-coding RNAs that are believed to be important in many biological processes through regulation of gene expression. The precise molecular function of miRNAs in mammals is largely unknown and a better understanding will require loss-of-function studies in vivo. Here we show that a novel class of chemically engineered oligonucleotides, termed `antagomirs', are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs in mice. Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR-16, miR-122, miR-192 and miR-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals. The silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting. The biological significance of silencing miRNAs with the use of antagomirs was studied for miR-122, an abundant liver-specific miRNA. Gene expression and bioinformatic analysis of messenger RNA from antagomir-treated animals revealed that the 3' untranslated regions of upregulated genes are strongly enriched in miR-122 recognition motifs, whereas downregulated genes are depleted in these motifs. Analysis of the functional annotation of downregulated genes specifically predicted that cholesterol biosynthesis genes would be affected by miR-122, and plasma cholesterol measurements showed reduced levels in antagomir-122-treated mice. Our findings show that antagomirs are powerful tools to silence specific miRNAs in vivo and may represent a therapeutic strategy for silencing miRNAs in disease.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Transcription factors are master regulatory switches of differentiation, including the development of specific hematopoietic lineages from stem cells. Here we show that mice with targeted disruption of the CCAAT enhancer binding protein Î± gene (C/EBPÎ±) demonstrate a selective block in differentiation of neutrophils. Mature neutrophils and eosinophils are not observed in the blood or fetal liver of mutant animals, while other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes, are not affected. Instead, most of the white cells in the peripheral blood of mutant mice had the appearance of myeloid blasts. We also observed a selective loss of expression of a critical gene target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein Î±, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. As a result, multipotential myeloid progenitors from the mutant fetal liver are unable to respond to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling, although they are capable of forming granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colonies in methylcellulose in response to other growth factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the lack of granulocyte development results from a defect intrinsic to the hematopoietic system; transplanted fetal liver from mutant mice can reconstitute lymphoid but not neutrophilic cells in irradiated recipients. These studies suggest a model by which transcription factors can direct the differentiation of multipotential precursors through activation of expression of a specific growth factor receptor, allowing proliferation and differentiation in response to a specific extracellular signal. In addition, the c/ebpÎ±<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice may be useful in understanding the mechanisms involved in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a block in differentiation of myeloid precursors is a key feature of the disease.',\n",

Investigations of the mode of action of this herbicide<SUP>2,3</SUP> have shown that it is a potent direct inhibitor of photosynthesis acting at the chloroplast level. The chemical analogy between 5-bromouracil and the foregoing 3,6-substituted 5-bromouracil suggested the possibility that it might be incorporated into DNA and thereby act as a mutagen. McGahen and Hoffmann<SUP>4,5</SUP> were unable to demonstrate incorporation of 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (IV) either into the DNA of a thymineless Escherichia coli (15T-) or into mouse liver DNA under conditions in which 5-bromouracil (5-BU) was incorporated. Their investigations, however, did not rule out the possibility of indirect mutagenic activity. The subject of this report is a comparison of the effects of 5-BU and 5-bromouracils with several different alkyl substituents at the 3 and/or 6 positions on the back-mutation of an aminopurine-induced rII mutant of coliphage T4.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The roles of miRNAs as important post-transcriptional regulators in the circadian clock have been suggested in several studies. But the search for circadian miRNAs has led to disparate results. Here we demonstrated that at least 57 miRNA primary transcripts are rhythmically transcribed in mouse liver. Most of these transcripts are under the regulation of circadian transcription factors such as BMAL1/CLOCK and REV-ERBÎ±/Î². However, the mature miRNAs derived from these transcripts are either not oscillating or oscillating at low amplitudes, which could explain the inconsistency of different circadian miRNA studies. In order to show that these circadian primary transcripts can give rise to miRNAs with circadian functions, we over-expressed one of them, miR-378, in mouse by adenovirus injection. We found a significant over-representation of circadian oscillating genes under-expressed by miR-378 over-expression in liver. In particular, we observed that miR-378 modulates the oscillation amplitudes of Cdkn1a in the control of cell cycle and Por in the regulation of oxidation reduction by forming partnership with different circadian transcription factors. Our study suggests that circadian transcription of miRNA at primary transcript level can be a good indicator for circadian miRNA functions.',\n",

Four different pairs of gene constructs, which were identical except that one member of each pair lacked all introns, were compared for expression of mRNA after introduction into the murine germ line by microinjection of fertilized eggs. The expression of two chimeric genes, made by fusing either the mouse metallothionein I or the rat elastase 1 promoter/enhancer to the rat growth hormone gene, was assayed in fetal liver or pancreas, respectively, while two natural genes, an oligonucleotide-marked mouse metallothionein I gene and the human beta-globin gene, were assayed in fetal liver. In each case there was, on average, 10- to 100-fold more mRNA produced from the intron-containing construct. Moreover, mRNA levels were proportional to the relative rates of transcription that were measured in isolated nuclei. However, when the expression of the two mouse metallothionein I gene-based constructs was tested after transfection into cultured cells, little difference was observed. These observations suggest that introns play a role in facilitating transcription of microinjected genes and that this effect may be manifest only on genes exposed to developmental influences.',\n",

Herein we describe GUIDE-tag, which enables one-step, off-target genome editing analysis in mouse liver and lung. The GUIDE-tag system utilizes tethering between the Cas9 nuclease and the DNA donor to increase the capture rate of nuclease-mediated DSBs and UMI incorporation via Tn5 tagmentation to avoid PCR bias. These components can be delivered as SpyCas9-mSA ribonucleoprotein complexes and biotin-dsDNA donor for in vivo editing analysis. GUIDE-tag enables detection of off-target sites where editing rates are â¥ 0.2%. UDiTaS analysis utilizing the same tagmented genomic DNA detects low frequency translocation events with off-target sites and large deletions in vivo. The SpyCas9-mSA and biotin-dsDNA system provides a method to capture DSB loci in vivo in a variety of tissues with a workflow that is amenable to analysis of gross genomic alterations that are associated with genome editing.',\n",

B. piliformis did not lose its capacity to infect hepatic cells of the mouse and produce typical liver lesions when subjected to serial passage in embryonated eggs. A non-sporing variant proved as pathogenic as the parent sporing strain and produced hepatic lesions in rats and hamsters. In general, suspensions prepared from infected yolk sac and chick embryo liver were sufficiently potent to produce liver infection when injected intraperitoneally and with a number of preparations fatal infection was obtained by intraperitoneal injection of adult mice not treated with cortisone. With active preparations the enhancing effect of cortisone was confirmed. Penicillin was found effective in checking experimental and naturally occurring infection. An increase in the severity of infection was demonstrated in mice implanted with a transplantable sarcoma, in which the organism multiplied.

That optical and non-destructive method is based on selected wavenumbers in the mid-infrared (MIR) range. We present a measuring system that substantially outperforms a commercially available Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Imaging system, since it enables acquisition of reduced spectral information at a scan field of 1 cm<SUP>2</SUP> in 3 s, with a spatial resolution of 20 Âµm. This allows fast visualization of segmented structure areas with little computational effort. For the first time, this multiphotometric MIR system is applied to biomedical tissue sections.

In vitro, adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ferumoxytol and macrophages showed increased caspase-3 activity. Macrophages exposed to ferumoxytol displayed increased mRNA associated with pro-inflammatory Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous adenocarcinomas in mice. In addition, intravenous ferumoxytol treatment before intravenous tumour cell challenge prevented development of liver metastasis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and histopathology studies showed that the observed tumour growth inhibition was accompanied by increased presence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumour tissues.

AÎ² plaque area was reduced more than 50% within just 72 hours. Furthermore, bexarotene stimulated the rapid reversal of cognitive, social, and olfactory deficits and improved neural circuit function.

       "    'abstract': 'Infection of mice with sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii has been used extensively to evaluate liver-stage protection by candidate preerythrocytic malaria vaccines. Unfortunately, repeated success of such vaccines in mice has not translated readily to effective malaria vaccines in humans. Thus, mice may be used better as models to dissect basic parameters required for immunity to Plasmodium-infection than as preclinical vaccine models. In turn, this basic information may aid in the rational design of malaria vaccines. Here, we describe a model of circumsporozoite-specific memory CD8 T cell generation that protects mice against multiple P. berghei sporozoite challenges for at least 19 months. Using this model we defined a threshold frequency of memory CD8 T cells in the blood that predicts long-term sterilizing immunity against liver-stage infection. Importantly, the number of Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T cells required for immunity greatly exceeds the number required for resistance to other pathogens. In addition, this model allowed us to identify readily individual immunized mice that exceed or fall below the protective threshold before infection, information that should greatly facilitate studies to dissect basic mechanisms of protective CD8 T cell memory against liver-stage Plasmodium infection. Furthermore, the extremely large threshold in memory CD8 T cell frequencies required for long-term protection in mice may have important implications for development of effective malaria vaccines.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors have shown early promise in clinical trials. The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, rAAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in animal models. However, preclinical animal studies are not always predictive of human outcome. Here, in an attempt to further our understanding of these discrepancies, we used a chimaeric human-murine liver model to compare directly the relative efficiency of rAAV transduction in human versus mouse hepatocytes in vivo. As predicted from preclinical and clinical studies, rAAV2 vectors functionally transduced mouse and human hepatocytes at equivalent but relatively low levels. However, rAAV8 vectors, which are very effective in many animal models, transduced human hepatocytes rather poorly--approximately 20 times less efficiently than mouse hepatocytes. In light of the limitations of the rAAV vectors currently used in clinical studies, we used the same murine chimaeric liver model to perform serial selection using a human-specific replication-competent viral library composed of DNA-shuffled AAV capsids. One chimaeric capsid composed of five different parental AAV capsids was found to transduce human primary hepatocytes at high efficiency in vitro and in vivo, and provided species-selected transduction in primary liver, cultured cells and a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model. This vector is an ideal clinical candidate and a reagent for gene modification of human xenotransplants in mouse models of human diseases. More importantly, our results suggest that humanized murine models may represent a more precise approach for both selecting and evaluating clinically relevant rAAV serotypes for gene therapeutic applications.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Fetal mouse liver hepatocytes proliferate on a substrate of irradiated pigskin epidermis scored with scalpel blade slits to permit cell access to the basement membrane. At the time the cells are explanted, fetal genes, such as those responsible for production of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGTase), are strongly expressed. The levels of GGTase decrease rapidly and become undetectable within 2 weeks. The levels of AFP decrease more gradually but become undetectable after 3-5 weeks in culture. As the AFP levels decrease, there is a concomitant increase in albumin production. Hydrocortisone prolongs production of AFP (for up to 8 weeks) but not of GGTase, and it decreases albumin production for up to 8 weeks. Once cells lose AFP expression, addition of hydrocortisone does not restart it. Based on these data, fetal mouse liver hepatocytes, cultured on pigskin, seem to be an excellent in vitro model for liver cell maturation.',\n",

The recent identification of a viral regulatory gene HBx suggests a possible direct involvement of the virus whereby the HBx protein, acting as a transcriptional transactivator of viral genes, may alter host gene expression and lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We have tested this possibility by placing the entire HBx gene under its own regulatory elements directly into the germline of mice. Transgenic animals harbouring this viral gene succumbed to progressive histopathological changes specifically in the liver, beginning with multifocal areas of altered hepatocytes, followed by the appearance of benign adenomas, and proceeding to the development of malignant carcinomas. Male mice developed disease and died much earlier than females. This transgenic animal model appears ideal for defining the molecular events that follow the expression of the viral HBx gene and are responsible for the development of liver cancer.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver may play a primary role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the mechanism by which insulin resistance occurs may be related to alterations in fat metabolism. Transgenic mice with muscle- and liver-specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase were studied during a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to determine the effect of tissue-specific increase in fat on insulin action and signaling. Muscle-lipoprotein lipase mice had a 3-fold increase in muscle triglyceride content and were insulin resistant because of decreases in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In contrast, liver-lipoprotein lipase mice had a 2-fold increase in liver triglyceride content and were insulin resistant because of impaired ability of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production associated with defects in insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. These defects in insulin action and signaling were associated with increases in intracellular fatty acid-derived metabolites (i.e., diacylglycerol, fatty acyl CoA, ceramides). Our findings suggest a direct and causative relationship between the accumulation of intracellular fatty acid-derived metabolites and insulin resistance mediated via alterations in the insulin signaling pathway, independent of circulating adipocyte-derived hormones.',\n",

Although the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is more commonly studied for its role in regulating xenobiotic metabolism and dioxin toxicity, a developmental role of this protein is supported by the observation that Ah null mice display smaller livers, reduced fecundity, and decreased body weights. Upon investigating the liver phenotype, we found that the decrease in liver size is directly related to a reduction in hepatocyte size. We also found that smaller hepatocyte size is the result of massive portosystemic shunting in null animals. Colloidal carbon uptake and microsphere perfusion studies indicated that 56% of portal blood flow bypasses the liver sinusoids. Latex corrosion casts and angiography demonstrated that shunting is consistent with the existence of a patent ductus venosus in adult animals. Importantly, fetal vascular structures were also observed at other sites. Intravital microscopy demonstrated an immature sinusoidal architecture in the liver and persistent hyaloid arteries in the eyes of adult Ah null mice, whereas corrosion casting experiments described aberrations in kidney vascular patterns.',\n",

Most of the assays use so-called \"normal\" cell strain because it is difficult to produce cell lines in which the disease conditions are reproduced. In this study, we used a cell-resealing technique, which reversibly permeabilizes the plasma membrane, to develop diabetic (Db) model hepatocytes into which cytosol from diabetic mouse liver had been introduced. Db model hepatocytes showed several disease-specific phenotypes, namely disturbance of insulin-induced repression of gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose secretion. Quantitative image analysis and principal component analysis revealed that the ratio of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) to Akt was the best index to describe the difference between wild-type and Db model hepatocytes. By performing image-based drug screening, we found pioglitazone, a PPARÎ³ agonist, increased the pAkt/Akt ratio, which in turn ameliorated the insulin-induced transcriptional repression of the gluconeogenic gene phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1. The disease-specific model cells coupled with image-based quantitative analysis should be useful for drug development, enabling the reconstitution of disease conditions at the cellular level and the discovery of disease-specific markers.',\n",

Current approaches for identifying secretory proteins from specific cell and tissue types are largely limited to in vitro or ex vivo models which often fail to recapitulate in vivo biology. As such, there is mounting interest in developing in vivo analytical tools that can provide accurate information on the origin, identity, and spatiotemporal dynamics of secretory proteins. Here, we describe iSLET (in situ Secretory protein Labeling via ER-anchored TurboID) which selectively labels proteins that transit through the classical secretory pathway via catalytic actions of Sec61b-TurboID, a proximity labeling enzyme anchored in the ER lumen. To validate iSLET in a whole-body system, we express iSLET in the mouse liver and demonstrate efficient labeling of liver secretory proteins which could be tracked and identified within circulating blood plasma. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of the labeled liver secretome enriched from liver iSLET mouse plasma is highly consistent with previous reports of liver secretory protein profiles. Taken together, iSLET is a versatile and powerful tool for studying spatiotemporal dynamics of secretory proteins, a valuable class of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.',\n",

In order to obtain reproducible results in spatial transcriptomics, we have to maintain tissue morphology and RNA molecule stability during the image acquisition and biomolecule collection processes.

In this method, we suppressed RNA degradation in fresh-frozen tissue specimens by dehydration fixation and effectively collected a small amount of RNA molecules from microdissection samples by magnetic beads. We demonstrated the spatial transcriptome analysis of the mouse liver and brain in serial microdissection samples (100 Î¼m in a diameter and 10 Î¼m in thickness) produced by a microdissection punching system. Using our method, we could prevent RNA degradation at room temperature and effectively produce a sequencing library with Smart-seq2. This resulted in reproducible sequence read mapping in exon regions and the detection of more than 2000 genes compared to non-fixed samples in the RNA-seq analysis. Our method would be applied to various transcriptome analyses, providing the information for region specific gene expression in tissue specimens.',\n",

We collected transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets from these mice using RNA-Seq and DNase-Seq. We found that both CR and HFD induce extensive transcriptional changes, in some cases altering the same genes in the same direction. We used our epigenomic data to infer transcriptional regulatory proteins bound near these genes that likely influence their expression levels. In particular, we found evidence for critical roles played by PPARÎ± and RXRÎ±. We used ChIP-Seq to profile the binding locations for these factors in HFD and CR livers. We found extensive binding of PPARÎ± near genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and uncovered a role for this factor in regulating anaerobic glycolysis. Overall, we generated extensive transcriptional and epigenomic datasets from livers of mice fed these diets and uncovered new functions and gene targets for PPARÎ±.',\n",

Unrepaired DNA lesions, such as single- and double-stranded DNA breaks (SSBs and DSBs), and single-stranded gaps can block progression of the DNA replication fork, causing replicative stress and/or cell cycle arrest. However, translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases, such as Rev1, have the ability to bypass some DNA lesions, which can circumvent the process leading to replication fork arrest and minimize replicative stress. Here, we show that Rev1-deficiency in mouse embryo fibroblasts or mouse liver tissue is associated with replicative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, Rev1-deficiency is associated with high poly(ADP) ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activity, low endogenous NAD<SUP>+</SUP>, low expression of SIRT1 and PGC1Î± and low adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) activity.

Expression patterns of miRNAs and their role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still poorly understood. We profiled miRNA expression in tissue samples (104 HCC, 90 adjacent cirrhotic livers, 21 normal livers) as well as in 35 HCC cell lines. A set of 12 miRNAs (including miR-21, miR-221/222, miR-34a, miR-519a, miR-93, miR-96, and let-7c) was linked to disease progression from normal liver through cirrhosis to full-blown HCC. miR-221/222, the most up-regulated miRNAs in tumor samples, are shown to target the CDK inhibitor p27 and to enhance cell growth in vitro. Conversely, these activities can be efficiently inhibited by an antagomiR specific for miR-221. In addition, we show, using a mouse model of liver cancer, that miR-221 overexpression stimulates growth of tumorigenic murine hepatic progenitor cells. Finally, we identified DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), a modulator of mTOR pathway, as a bona fide target of miR-221. Taken together, these data reveal an important contribution for miR-221 in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest a role for DDIT4 dysregulation in this process.

       "    'abstract': 'RNA interference (RNAi) is a universal and evolutionarily conserved phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing by means of sequence-specific mRNA degradation, triggered by small double-stranded RNAs. Because this mechanism can be efficiently induced in vivo by expressing target-complementary short hairpin RNA (shRNA) from non-viral and viral vectors, RNAi is attractive for functional genomics and human therapeutics. Here we systematically investigate the long-term effects of sustained high-level shRNA expression in livers of adult mice. Robust shRNA expression in all the hepatocytes after intravenous infusion was achieved with an optimized shRNA delivery vector based on duplex-DNA-containing adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8). An evaluation of 49 distinct AAV/shRNA vectors, unique in length and sequence and directed against six targets, showed that 36 resulted in dose-dependent liver injury, with 23 ultimately causing death. Morbidity was associated with the downregulation of liver-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), indicating possible competition of the latter with shRNAs for limiting cellular factors required for the processing of various small RNAs. In vitro and in vivo shRNA transfection studies implied that one such factor, shared by the shRNA/miRNA pathways and readily saturated, is the nuclear karyopherin exportin-5. Our findings have fundamental consequences for future RNAi-based strategies in animals and humans, because controlling intracellular shRNA expression levels will be imperative. However, the risk of oversaturating endogenous small RNA pathways can be minimized by optimizing shRNA dose and sequence, as exemplified here by our report of persistent and therapeutic RNAi against human hepatitis B virus in vivo.',\n",

CRIg plays important roles in several immune-mediated diseases, but it is not clear how its pathogen recognition and phagocytic functions maintain homeostasis and prevent disease. We previously associated cytolysin-positive Enterococcus faecalis with severity of alcohol-related liver disease. Here, we demonstrate that CRIg is reduced in liver tissues from patients with alcohol-related liver disease. CRIg-deficient mice developed more severe ethanol-induced liver disease than wild-type mice; disease severity was reduced with loss of toll-like receptor 2. CRIg-deficient mice were less efficient than wild-type mice at clearing Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis that had translocated from gut to liver. Administration of the soluble extracellular domain CRIg-Ig protein protected mice from ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. Our findings indicate that ethanol impairs hepatic clearance of translocated pathobionts, via decreased hepatic CRIg, which facilitates progression of liver disease.',\n",

Because the TAK1 downstream molecules NF-ÎºB and JNK have opposite effects on cell death and carcinogenesis, the role of TAK1 in the liver is unpredictable. To address this issue, we generated hepatocyte-specific Tak1-deficient (Tak1ÎHEP) mice. The Tak1ÎHEP mice displayed spontaneous hepatocyte death, compensatory proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and perisinusoidal fibrosis at age 1 month. Older Tak1ÎHEP mice developed multiple cancer nodules characterized by increased expression of fetal liver genes including Î±-fetoprotein. Cultures of primary hepatocytes deficient in Tak1 exhibited spontaneous cell death that was further increased in response to TNF-Î±. TNF-Î± increased caspase-3 activity but activated neither NF-ÎºB nor JNK in Tak1-deficient hepatocytes. Genetic abrogation of TNF receptor type I (TNFRI) in Tak1ÎHEP mice reduced liver damage, inflammation, and fibrosis compared with unmodified Tak1ÎHEP mice. In conclusion, hepatocyte-specific deletion of TAK1 in mice resulted in spontaneous hepatocyte death, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis that was partially mediated by TNFR signaling, indicating that TAK1 is an essential component for cellular homeostasis in the liver.',\n",

Although proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested to contribute to the development of these disorders, the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that overexpression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 in liver causes insulin resistance and an increase in the key regulator of fatty acid synthesis in liver, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c. Conversely, inhibition of SOCS-1 and -3 in obese diabetic mice improves insulin sensitivity, normalizes the increased expression of SREBP-1c, and dramatically ameliorates hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. In obese animals, increased SOCS proteins enhance SREBP-1c expression by antagonizing STAT3-mediated inhibition of SREBP-1c promoter activity. Thus, SOCS proteins play an important role in pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome by concordantly modulating insulin signaling and cytokine signaling.',\n",

The main functions of exosomes have been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication and as potential biomarkers of various disease states. This study investigated whether exogenous exosomes from mice with acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury can damage the recipient hepatic cells or promote hepatotoxicity in mice. We observed that exogenous exosomes derived from APAP-exposed mice were internalized into the primary mouse hepatocytes or HepG2 hepatoma cells and significantly decreased the viability of these recipient cells. They also elevated mRNA transcripts and proteins associated with the cell death signaling pathways in primary hepatocytes or HepG2 cells via exosomes-to-cell communications. In addition, confocal microscopy of ex vivo liver section showed that exogenously added exosomes were accumulated in recipient hepatocytes. Furthermore, plasma reactive oxygen species and hepatic TNF-Î±/IL-1Î² production were elevated in APAP-exosomes recipient mice compared to control-exosomes recipient mice. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins such as phospho-JNK/JNK, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 were increased in mouse liver received APAP-exosomes. These results demonstrate that exogenous exosomes from APAP-exposed mice with acute liver injury are functional and stimulate cell death or toxicity of the recipient hepatocytes and mice.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The multi-component mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is the central node of a mammalian pathway that coordinates cell growth with the availability of nutrients, energy and growth factors. Progress has been made in the identification of mTORC1 pathway components and in understanding their functions in cells, but there is relatively little known about the role of the pathway in vivo. Specifically, we have little knowledge regarding the role mTOCR1 has in liver physiology. In fasted animals, the liver performs numerous functions that maintain whole-body homeostasis, including the production of ketone bodies for peripheral tissues to use as energy sources. Here we show that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice in response to fasting. We find that liver-specific loss of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1), an mTORC1 inhibitor, leads to a fasting-resistant increase in liver size, and to a pronounced defect in ketone body production and ketogenic gene expression on fasting. The loss of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1) an essential mTORC1 component, has the opposite effects. In addition, we find that the inhibition of mTORC1 is required for the fasting-induced activation of PPARÎ± (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î±), the master transcriptional activator of ketogenic genes, and that suppression of NCoR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1), a co-repressor of PPARÎ±, reactivates ketogenesis in cells and livers with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Like livers with activated mTORC1, livers from aged mice have a defect in ketogenesis, which correlates with an increase in mTORC1 signalling. Moreover, we show that the suppressive effects of mTORC1 activation and ageing on PPARÎ± activity and ketone production are not additive, and that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to prevent the ageing-induced defect in ketogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that mTORC1 is a key regulator of PPARÎ± function and hepatic ketogenesis and suggest a role for mTORC1 activity in promoting the ageing of the liver.',\n",

Antibiotic treatment prevented mortality in this model, suppressed growth of E. gallinarum in tissues, and eliminated pathogenic autoantibodies and T cells. Hepatocyte-E. gallinarum cocultures induced autoimmune-promoting factors. Pathobiont translocation in monocolonized and autoimmune-prone mice induced autoantibodies and caused mortality, which could be prevented by an intramuscular vaccine targeting the pathobiont. E. gallinarum-specific DNA was recovered from liver biopsies of autoimmune patients, and cocultures with human hepatocytes replicated the murine findings; hence, similar processes apparently occur in susceptible humans.

We integrate recent heavy ion data on liver, colorectal, intestinal, lung, and Harderian gland tumors with other data from fission neutron experiments into the model analysis. In an earlier work we introduced distinct QFs for leukemia and solid cancer risk predictions, and here we consider liver cancer risks separately because of the higher RBE's reported in mouse experiments compared to other tumors types, and distinct risk factors for liver cancer for astronauts compared to the U.S. population. The revised model is used to make predictions of fatal cancer and circulatory disease risks for 1-year deep space and International Space Station (ISS) missions, and a 940 day Mars mission. We analyzed the contribution of the various model parameter uncertainties to the overall uncertainty, which shows that the uncertainties in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factors at high LET due to statistical uncertainties and differences across tissue types and mouse strains are the dominant uncertainty. NASA's exposure limits are approached or exceeded for each mission scenario considered. Two main conclusions are made: 1) Reducing the current estimate of about a 3-fold uncertainty to a 2-fold or lower uncertainty will require much more expansive animal carcinogenesis studies in order to reduce statistical uncertainties and understand tissue, sex and genetic variations. 2) Alternative model assumptions such as non-targeted effects, increased tumor lethality and decreased latency at high LET, and non-cancer mortality risks from circulatory diseases could significantly increase risk estimates to several times higher than the NASA limits.\",\n",

The transformation frequency observed was between 1 and 10 colonies per 10(6) cells per 20 microgram of donor DNA. Transformants displayed enzymatic activity that was donor derived as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing of cytoplasmic extracts. These transformants fall into two classes: those that are phenotypically stable when grown in the absence of selective pressure and those that are phenotypically unstable under the same conditions.',\n",

The application of comprehensive gene expression profiling technologies to compare normal and diseased tissues or to assess molecular alterations resulting from various experimental interventions has the potential to provide highly detailed qualitative and quantitative descriptions of these processes. Ideally, to interpret experimental data, the magnitude and diversity of gene expression for the system under study should be well characterized, yet little is known about the normal variation of mouse gene expression in vivo. To assess natural differences in murine gene expression, we used a 5406-clone spotted cDNA microarray to quantitate transcript levels in the kidney, liver, and testis from each of 6 normal male C57BL6 mice. We used ANOVA to compare the variance across the six mice to the variance among four replicate experiments performed for each mouse tissue. For the 6 kidney samples, 102 of 3,088 genes (3.3%) exhibited a statistically significant mouse variance at a level of 0.05. In the testis, 62 of 3,252 genes (1.9%) showed statistically significant variance, and in the liver, there were 21 of 2,514 (0.8%) genes with significantly variable expression. Immune-modulated, stress-induced, and hormonally regulated genes were highly represented among the transcripts that were most variable. The expression levels of several genes varied significantly in more than one tissue. These studies help to define the baseline level of variability in mouse gene expression and emphasize the importance of replicate microarray experiments.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We recently reported the hemochromatosis-like phenotype observed in our Usf2 knockout mice. In these mice, as in murine models of hemochromatosis and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, iron accumulates in parenchymal cells (in particular, liver and pancreas), whereas the reticuloendothelial system is spared from this iron loading. We suggested that this phenotypic trait could be attributed to the absence, in the Usf2 knockout mice, of a secreted liver-specific peptide, hepcidin. We conjectured that the reverse situation, namely overexpression of hepcidin, might result in phenotypic traits of iron deficiency. This question was addressed by generating transgenic mice expressing hepcidin under the control of the liver-specific transthyretin promoter. We found that the majority of the transgenic mice were born with a pale skin and died within a few hours after birth. These transgenic animals had decreased body iron levels and presented severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. So far, three mosaic transgenic animals have survived. They were unequivocally identified by physical features, including reduced body size, pallor, hairless and crumpled skin. These pleiotropic effects were found to be associated with erythrocyte abnormalities, with marked anisocytosis, poikylocytosis and hypochromia, which are features characteristic of iron-deficiency anemia. These results strongly support the proposed role of hepcidin as a putative iron-regulatory hormone. The animal models devoid of hepcidin (the Usf2 knockout mice) or overexpressing the peptide (the transgenic mice presented in this paper) represent valuable tools for investigating iron homeostasis in vivo and for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of hepcidin action.',\n",

To investigate this issue, we constructed a mutant mouse strain, Apc<SUP>lox/lox</SUP>, in which exon 14 of the tumor-suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is flanked by loxP sequences. i.v. injection of adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (AdCre) at high multiplicity [10<SUP>9</SUP> plaque-forming units (pfu) per mouse] inactivated the Apc gene in the liver and resulted in marked hepatomegaly, hepatocyte hyperplasia, and rapid mortality. Î²-Catenin signaling activation was demonstrated by nuclear and cytoplasmic accumulation of Î²-catenin in the hepatocytes and by the induction of Î²-catenin target genes (glutamine synthetase, glutamate transporter 1, ornithine aminotransferase, and leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) in the liver. To test a long-term oncogenic effect, we inoculated mice with lower doses of AdCre (0.5 Ã 10<SUP>9</SUP> pfu per mouse), compatible with both survival and persistence of Î²-catenin-activated cells. In these conditions, 67% of mice developed HCC. Î²-Catenin signaling was strongly activated in these Apc-inactivated HCCs. The HCCs were well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. Indeed, their histological and molecular features mimicked human HCC. Thus, deletion of Apc in the liver provides a valuable model of human HCC, and, in this model, activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway by invalidation of Apc is required for liver tumorigenesis.',\n",

Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks.

       "    'abstract': 'The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that is often aberrantly activated in cancer. However, mTORC1 inhibitors, such as rapamycin, have limited effectiveness as single agent cancer therapies, with feedback mechanisms inherent to the signaling network thought to diminish the anti-tumor effects of mTORC1 inhibition. Here, we identify the protein kinase and proto-oncogene PIM3 as being repressed downstream of mTORC1 signaling. PIM3 expression is suppressed in cells with loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors, which exhibit growth factor-independent activation of mTORC1, and in the mouse liver upon feeding-induced activation of mTORC1. Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin induces PIM3 transcript and protein levels in a variety of settings. Suppression of PIM3 involves the sterol regulatory element-binding (SREBP) transcription factors SREBP1 and 2, whose activation and mRNA expression are stimulated by mTORC1 signaling. We find that PIM3 repression is mediated by miR-33, an intronic microRNA encoded within the SREBP loci, the expression of which is decreased with rapamycin. These results demonstrate that PIM3 is induced upon mTORC1 inhibition, with potential implications for the effects of mTORC1 inhibitors in TSC, cancers, and the many other disease settings influenced by aberrant mTORC1 signaling.',\n",

Disruptions in this process caused by defective embryonic development, or through ductal reaction in liver disease have a major impact on life quality and survival of patients. A deep understanding of the processes underlying bile duct lumen formation is crucial to identify intervention points to avoid or treat the appearance of defective bile ducts. Several hypotheses have been proposed to characterize the biophysical mechanisms driving initial bile duct lumen formation during embryogenesis. Here, guided by the quantification of morphological features and expression of genes in bile ducts from embryonic mouse liver, we sharpened these hypotheses and collected data to develop a high resolution individual cell-based computational model that enables to test alternative hypotheses in silico. This model permits realistic simulations of tissue and cell mechanics at sub-cellular scale. Our simulations suggest that successful bile duct lumen formation requires a simultaneous contribution of directed cell division of cholangiocytes, local osmotic effects generated by salt excretion in the lumen, and temporally-controlled differentiation of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes, with apical constriction of cholangiocytes only moderately affecting luminal size.',\n",

Recent reports have shown that a novel genome-editing tool using Cas9 with a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) system can cleave the HBV genome in vitro and in vivo. However, induction of a double-strand break (DSB) on the targeted genome by Cas9 risks undesirable off-target cleavage on the host genome. Nickase-Cas9 cleaves a single strand of DNA, and thereby two sgRNAs are required for inducing DSBs. To avoid Cas9-induced off-target mutagenesis, we examined the effects of the expressions of nickase-Cas9 and nuclease dead Cas9 (d-Cas9) with sgRNAs on HBV replication. The expression of nickase-Cas9 with a pair of sgRNAs cleaved the target HBV genome and suppressed the viral-protein expression and HBV replication in vitro. Moreover, nickase-Cas9 with the sgRNA pair cleaved the targeted HBV genome in mouse liver. Interestingly, d-Cas9 expression with the sgRNAs also suppressed HBV replication in vitro without cleaving the HBV genome.

Previously, we showed that oral supplementation with ABA decreased parasitemia in a mouse model of malaria, decreased liver and spleen pathology and reduced parasite transmission to mosquitoes. Here, we report that higher circulating ABA levels were associated with a reduced risk of symptomatic malaria in a cohort of Plasmodium falciparum-infected Ugandan children. To understand possible mechanisms of ABA protection in malaria, we returned to our mouse model to show that ABA effects on Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL infection were accompanied by minimal effects on complete blood count and blood chemistry analytes, suggesting a benefit to host health. In addition, orally delivered ABA induced patterns of gene expression in mouse liver and spleen that suggested enhancement of host anti-parasite defenses. To test these inferences, we utilized passive immunization and knockout mice to demonstrate that ABA supplementation increases circulating levels of protective, parasite-specific IgG and requires caspase-1 to reduce parasitemia. Collectively, ABA induces host responses that ameliorate infection and disease in an animal model and suggest that further studies of ABA in the context of human malaria are warranted.',\n",

Here we show that hepatic Angptl8 is rhythmically expressed, which involving the liver X receptor alpha (LXRÎ±) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulation during feeding and fasting periods, respectively. In addition, Angptl8 mRNA is very unstable, which contributes to the nature of its daily rhythmicity by rapidly responding to fasting/feeding transition. To explore its pathological function in dexamethasone (DEX)-induced fatty liver, we reversed its suppression by glucocorticoids through adenoviral delivery of Angptl8 gene in mouse liver. Surprisingly, hepatic overexpression of Angptl8 dramatically elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels in DEX-treated mice, suggesting a metabolic interaction between Angptl8 and glucocorticoid signaling. Moreover, intracellular hepatic Angptl8 is implicated in the regulation of lipid homeostasis by the experiments with ectopic expression of a nonsecreted Angptl8 mutant (Î25-Angptl8). Altogether, our data demonstrate the molecular mechanism of the diurnal rhythm of Angptl8 expression regulated by glucocorticoid signaling and LXRÎ± pathway, and provide new evidence to understand the role of Angptl8 in maintaining plasma TG homeostasis.',\n",

Missense mutations in PCSK9 cause an autosomal dominant form of hypercholesterolemia in humans, likely due to a gain-of-function mechanism because overexpression of either WT or mutant PCSK9 reduces hepatic LDL receptor protein (LDLR) in mice. Here, we show that livers of knockout mice lacking PCSK9 manifest increased LDLR protein but not mRNA. Increased LDLR protein led to increased clearance of circulating lipoproteins and decreased plasma cholesterol levels (46 mg/dl in Pcsk9<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice versus 96 mg/dl in WT mice). Statins, a class of drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis, increase expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), a transcription factor that activates both the Ldlr and Pcsk9 genes. Statin administration to Pcsk9<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice produced an exaggerated increase in LDLRs in liver and enhanced LDL clearance from plasma. These data demonstrate that PCSK9 regulates the amount of LDLR protein in liver and suggest that inhibitors of PCSK9 may act synergistically with statins to enhance LDLRs and reduce plasma cholesterol.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'During embryogenesis, endothelial cells induce organogenesis before the development of circulation. These findings suggest that endothelial cells not only form passive conduits to deliver nutrients and oxygen, but also establish an instructive vascular niche, which through elaboration of paracrine trophogens stimulates organ regeneration, in a manner similar to endothelial-cell-derived angiocrine factors that support haematopoiesis. However, the precise mechanism by which tissue-specific subsets of endothelial cells promote organogenesis in adults is unknown. Here we demonstrate that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute a unique population of phenotypically and functionally defined VEGFR3<SUP>+</SUP>CD34<SUP>-</SUP>VEGFR2<SUP>+</SUP>VE-cadherin<SUP>+</SUP>FactorVIII<SUP>+</SUP>CD45<SUP>-</SUP> endothelial cells, which through the release of angiocrine trophogens initiate and sustain liver regeneration induced by 70% partial hepatectomy. After partial hepatectomy, residual liver vasculature remains intact without experiencing hypoxia or structural damage, which allows study of physiological liver regeneration. Using this model, we show that inducible genetic ablation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in the LSECs impairs the initial burst of hepatocyte proliferation (days 1-3 after partial hepatectomy) and subsequent reconstitution of the hepatovascular mass (days 4-8 after partial hepatectomy) by inhibiting upregulation of the endothelial-cell-specific transcription factor Id1. Accordingly, Id1-deficient mice also manifest defects throughout liver regeneration, owing to diminished expression of LSEC-derived angiocrine factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Wnt2. Notably, in in vitro co-cultures, VEGFR2-Id1 activation in LSECs stimulates hepatocyte proliferation. Indeed, intrasplenic transplantation of Id1<SUP>+/+</SUP> or Id1<SUP>-/-</SUP> LSECs transduced with Wnt2 and HGF (Id1<SUP>-/-</SUP>Wnt2<SUP>+</SUP>HGF<SUP>+</SUP> LSECs) re-establishes an inductive vascular niche in the liver sinusoids of the Id1<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice, initiating and restoring hepatovascular regeneration. Therefore, in the early phases of physiological liver regeneration, VEGFR2-Id1-mediated inductive angiogenesis in LSECs through release of angiocrine factors Wnt2 and HGF provokes hepatic proliferation. Subsequently, VEGFR2-Id1-dependent proliferative angiogenesis reconstitutes liver mass. Therapeutic co-transplantation of inductive VEGFR2<SUP>+</SUP>Id1<SUP>+</SUP>Wnt2<SUP>+</SUP>HGF<SUP>+</SUP> LSECs with hepatocytes provides an effective strategy to achieve durable liver regeneration.',\n",

Although safety has been well documented in small ablations, our aim is to assess its safety and feasibility when a large portion of liver is ablated.

One group consisted in 55 athymic-nude, in which a tumor from the KM12C cell line was grown and the other thirty-two C57-Bl6 non-tumoral mice. Both groups were subsequently divided into subsets according to the delivered field strength (1000\\u2009V/cm, 2000\\u2009V/cm) and whether or not they received anti-hyperkalemia therapy. Early mortality (less than 24\\u2009hours post-IRE) in the 2000\\u2009V/cm group was observed and revealed considerably higher mean potassium levels. In contrast, the animals subjected to a 2000\\u2009V/cm field treated with the anti-hyperkalemia therapy had higher survival rates (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.1, 95%CI\\u2009=\\u20090.02-0.32, p\\u2009&lt;\\u20090.001).

Computational models of tissue microstructure can be employed with ultrasound propagation simulators to investigate these relationships. This paper introduces a three-dimensional microanatomical model in which tissue is treated as a population of stochastically positioned spherical cells embedded in a homogeneous extracellular matrix, where each cell consists of a spherical nucleus surrounded by homogeneous cytoplasm. The model is used to represent the microstructure of both healthy mouse liver and experimental liver metastasis. Normal and cancerous tissue specimens stained with DAPI and H&amp;E are digitized at 20Ã magnification and analyzed to specify values of the model parameters. Simulated healthy and tumor tissues are initialized based on the ratio of cell to nucleus diameter and the nuclear volume fraction and size distribution estimated by stereological analysis of the normal and cancerous liver specimens, respectively. For each simulated tissue, the spatial organization of cells is controlled by a Gibbs-Markov point process. The parameters of the Gibbs-Markov process are tuned to accurately reproduce the number density and distribution of center-to-center spacing of nuclei in the DAPI-stained slides of the corresponding experimental tissue specimen. The morphological variations that can be produced by changing the model parameters are expected to be sufficient to represent the microstructural changes during tumor progression that are the most significant determinants of high-frequency ultrasound backscattering.',\n",

Acoustic methods for the selective in vivo detection of these imaging agents are needed to maximize their impact in biology and medicine. Existing ultrasound pulse sequences use the nonlinearity in contrast agents' response to acoustic pressure to distinguish them from mostly linear tissue scattering. However, such pulse sequences typically scan the sample using focused transmissions, resulting in a limited frame rate and restricted field of view. Meanwhile, existing wide-field scanning techniques based on plane wave transmissions suffer from limited sensitivity or nonlinear artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an ultrafast nonlinear imaging modality combining amplitude-modulated pulses, multiplane wave transmissions, and selective coherent compounding. This technique achieves contrast imaging sensitivity comparable to much slower gold-standard amplitude modulation sequences and enables the acquisition of larger and deeper fields of view, while providing a much faster imaging framerate of 3.2 kHz. Additionally, it enables simultaneous nonlinear and linear image formation and allows concurrent monitoring of phenomena accessible only at ultrafast framerates, such as blood volume variations. We demonstrate the performance of this ultrafast amplitude modulation technique by imaging gas vesicles, an emerging class of genetically encodable biomolecular contrast agents, in several in vitro and in vivo contexts. These demonstrations include the rapid discrimination of moving contrast agents and the real-time monitoring of phagolysosomal function in the mouse liver.\",\n",

Acute and chronic exposures to C. raciborskii in Australia have been linked to liver damage (hepatotoxicity) with concomitant effects on the kidneys, adrenal glands, small intestine, lungs, thymus, and heart. The alkaloid cylindrospermopsin, which produces these toxic effects, is thought to be a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. C. raciborskii strains producing cylindrospermopsin or analogue alkaloids have also been reported in Florida, USA, and Thailand. Brazilian isolates of C. raciborskii are also toxic but act by a different mechanism, causing acute death in mice with neurotoxic symptoms similar to those induced by the saxitoxins. In this article we compare the toxicity in the mouse of a C. raciborskii French strain with C. raciborskii strains from various other sources (Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Hungary). We tested the toxicity of cell extracts by a mouse bioassay. Acute, fatal neurotoxicity was produced by the Brazilian strain, which was confirmed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection of the cell extracts, which revealed the presence of saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin, and decarbamoylsaxitoxin, along with two unidentified compounds. Acute hepatotoxicity with severe liver, kidney, and thymus damage was observed with the Australian cylindrospermopsinâproducing strain. The Mexican and Hungarian strains were not found to be toxic to mice in our experimental conditions. No animals died after exposure to the extracts of the French C. raciborskii strain. Histological examination of the liver revealed moderate, multifocal necrosis characterized by small areas of hepatocellular necrosis, combined with disorganization of the parenchyma and congestion of the inner sinusoid. These symptoms and lesions resembled those induced by cylindrospermopsin, but the chemical analysis performed by liquid chromatography coupled with either a diode array detector or a mass spectrometer demonstrated that this toxin was not present in our culture extract.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 are important members of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) family and are implicated in the hepatic disposition of endobiotics and xenobiotics. Quantitating the expression levels of human OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 in in vitro systems and tissue samples could significantly improve attempts to scale up in vitro data and result in more effective in vitro-in vivo correlation of transporter-mediated effects on drug disposition, such as hepatic clearance. In the present study, a quantification method was developed, characterized, and implemented for simultaneous determination of human OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 in HEK cells transfected with OATP-expressing plasmid vectors (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and SLCO2B1, respectively), human hepatocytes, human brain capillary endothelial cells, and humanized mouse liver tissue using UPLC-MRM MS. Purified membrane protein standards prepared and characterized as previously reported (Protein Expr. Purif. 2008, 57, 163-71) were first used as standards for absolute quantification of the expression levels of the three human OATP membrane proteins. The specificity of the optimized MRM transitions were characterized by analyzing the tryptic digests of the membrane protein fraction of wild type HEK cells and control mouse liver tissue using the herein reported UPLC-MRM MS method. The linearity of the calibration curve spanned from 0.2 Î¼g mL<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.040 Î¼g mg<SUP>-1</SUP>) to 20 Î¼g mL<SUP>-1</SUP> (4.0 Î¼g mg<SUP>-1</SUP>), with accuracy (% RE) within 15% at all concentrations examined for all three OATPs of interest in this study. The intra- and inter-day assay accuracy (% RE) and coefficient of variations (% CV) of triplicates are all within 15% for all levels of quality control samples prepared by mixing the membrane fraction of control mouse liver tissue with the required amount of purified human OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'This study investigated the effect of Akkermansia muciniphila on fatty liver disease. Although some research about the effects of A. muciniphila on host health has been published, study of the relationship between A. muciniphila administration and fatty liver, as well as changes in the gut microbiota, has not been conducted. In this study, we demonstrated that A. muciniphila prevented fatty liver disease by regulation of the expression of genes that regulate fat synthesis and inflammation in the liver. ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria on fatty liver disease. Five-week-old C57BL/6N mice were administered either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control) or A. muciniphila at 10 8 to 10 9 CFU/ml, and were fed either a 45% fat diet (high-fat diet [HFD]) or a 10% fat diet (normal diet [ND]) for 10 weeks. After 10 weeks, the mice were euthanized, and blood and tissue samples, including adipose tissue, cecum, liver, and brain, were immediately collected. Biochemical and histological analyses were conducted, and the expression levels of related factors were compared to determine the antiobesity effects of Akkermansia muciniphila . The gut microbiome was analyzed in fecal samples. Oral administration of A. muciniphila significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) lowered serum triglyceride (TG) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in obese mice. Compared to the non- A. muciniphila -treated group, the expression of SREBP (regulator of TG synthesis in liver tissue) was decreased in the A. muciniphila -treated group. The expression of IL-6 in the liver of obese mice was decreased following the administration of A. muciniphila . Furthermore, alterations in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and the decrease in bacterial diversity caused by the HFD were restored upon the administration of A. muciniphila . These results indicate that A. muciniphila prevents fatty liver disease in obese mice by regulating TG synthesis in the liver and maintaining gut homeostasis. IMPORTANCE This study investigated the effect of Akkermansia muciniphila on fatty liver disease. Although some research about the effects of A. muciniphila on host health has been published, study of the relationship between A. muciniphila administration and fatty liver, as well as changes in the gut microbiota, has not been conducted. In this study, we demonstrated that A. muciniphila prevented fatty liver disease by regulation of the expression of genes that regulate fat synthesis and inflammation in the liver.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We have imaged, in real time, fluorescent tumors growing and metastasizing in live mice. The whole-body optical imaging system is external and noninvasive. It affords unprecedented continuous visual monitoring of malignant growth and spread within intact animals. We have established new human and rodent tumors that stably express very high levels of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transplanted these to appropriate animals. B16F0-GFP mouse melanoma cells were injected into the tail vein or portal vein of 6-week-old C57BL/6 and nude mice. Whole-body optical images showed metastatic lesions in the brain, liver, and bone of B16F0-GFP that were used for real time, quantitative measurement of tumor growth in each of these organs. The AC3488-GFP human colon cancer was surgically implanted orthotopically into nude mice. Whole-body optical images showed, in real time, growth of the primary colon tumor and its metastatic lesions in the liver and skeleton. Imaging was with either a trans-illuminated epifluorescence microscope or a fluorescence light box and thermoelectrically cooled color charge-coupled device camera. The depth to which metastasis and micrometastasis could be imaged depended on their size. A 60-Î¼m diameter tumor was detectable at a depth of 0.5 mm whereas a 1,800-Î¼m tumor could be visualized at 2.2-mm depth. The simple, noninvasive, and highly selective imaging of growing tumors, made possible by strong GFP fluorescence, enables the detailed imaging of tumor growth and metastasis formation. This should facilitate studies of modulators of cancer growth including inhibition by potential chemotherapeutic agents.',\n",

Here, we generated mice carrying a floxed EGFR allele to inactivate the EGFR in fetal and adult liver. Perinatal deletion of EGFR in hepatocytes resulted in decreased body weight, whereas deletion in the adult liver did not affect body mass. Although liver function was not affected, after partial hepatectomy mice lacking EGFR in the liver showed increased mortality accompanied by increased levels of serum transaminases indicating liver damage. Liver regeneration was delayed in the mutants because of reduced hepatocyte proliferation. Analysis of cell cycle progression in EGFR-deficient livers indicated a defective G<SUB>1</SUB>-S phase entry with delayed transcriptional activation and reduced protein expression of cyclin D1 followed by reduced cdk2 and cdk1 expression. Impaired liver regeneration was accompanied by compensatory up-regulation of TNFÎ± in the serum and prolonged activation of c-Jun. Moreover, p38Î± and NF-ÎºB activation was reduced in regenerating mutant livers, indicating an impaired stress response after hepatectomy. Our studies demonstrate that EGFR is a critical regulator of hepatocyte proliferation in the initial phases of liver regeneration.',\n",

Although Vps34 is known to play an essential role in autophagy in yeast, its role in mammals remains elusive. To elucidate the physiological function of Vps34 and to determine its precise role in autophagy, we have generated Vps34<SUP>f/f</SUP> mice, in which expression of Cre recombinase results in a deletion of exon 4 of Vps34 and a frame shift causing a deletion of 755 of the 887 amino acids of Vps34. Acute ablation of Vps34 in MEFs upon adenoviral Cre infection results in a diminishment of localized generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and blockade of both endocytic and autophagic degradation. Starvation-induced autophagosome formation is blocked in both Vps34-null MEFs and liver. Liver-specific Albumin-Cre;Vps34<SUP>f/f</SUP> mice developed hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, and impaired protein turnover. Ablation of Vps34 in the heart of muscle creatine kinase-Cre;Vps34<SUP>f/f</SUP> mice led to cardiomegaly and decreased contractility. In addition, while amino acid-stimulated mTOR activation was suppressed in the absence of Vps34, the steady-state level of mTOR signaling was not affected in Vps34-null MEFs, liver, or cardiomyocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that Vps34 plays an essential role in regulating functional autophagy and is indispensable for normal liver and heart function.',\n",

Recent studies have suggested that the DNA component of NETs (NET-DNA) is associated with cancer metastasis in mouse models<SUP>4-6</SUP>. However, the functional role and clinical importance of NET-DNA in metastasis in patients with cancer remain unclear. Here we show that NETs are abundant in the liver metastases of patients with breast and colon cancers, and that serum NETs can predict the occurrence of liver metastases in patients with early-stage breast cancer. NET-DNA acts as a chemotactic factor to attract cancer cells, rather than merely acting as a `trap' for them; in several mouse models, NETs in the liver or lungs were found to attract cancer cells to form distant metastases. We identify the transmembrane protein CCDC25 as a NET-DNA receptor on cancer cells that senses extracellular DNA and subsequently activates the ILK-Î²-parvin pathway to enhance cell motility. NET-mediated metastasis is abrogated in CCDC25-knockout cells. Clinically, we show that the expression of CCDC25 on primary cancer cells is closely associated with a poor prognosis for patients. Overall, we describe a transmembrane DNA receptor that mediates NET-dependent metastasis, and suggest that targeting CCDC25 could be an appealing therapeutic strategy for the prevention of cancer metastasis.\",\n",

Conventional carriers, however, cannot generally be used because they are eliminated by the reticulo-endothelial system within seconds or minutes after intravenous injection. To address these limitations, monodisperse biodegradable nanospheres were developed from amphiphilic copolymers composed of two biocompatible blocks. The nanospheres exhibited dramatically increased blood circulation times and reduced liver accumulation in mice. Furthermore, they entrapped up to 45 percent by weight of the drug in the dense core in a one-step procedure and could be freeze-dried and easily redispersed without additives in aqueous solutions.',\n",

The classical theory of this regulation is that most IGF-I in the blood originates in the liver and that body growth is controlled by the concentration of IGF-I in the blood. We have abolished IGF-I production in the livers of mice by using the Cre/loxP recombination system. These mice demonstrated complete inactivation of the IGF-I gene in the hepatocytes. Although the liver accounts for less than 5% of body mass, the concentration of IGF-I in the serum was reduced by 75%. This finding confirms that the liver is the principal source of IGF-I in the blood. However, the reduction in serum IGF-I concentration had no discernible effect on postnatal body growth. We conclude that postnatal body growth is preserved despite complete absence of IGF-I production by the hepatocytes.',\n",

It was similarly effective in reversing behavioral deficits and plaque load in APPSwInd mice (line J20). The temporal sequence involved an increase in plasma AÎ² and a decrease in brain AÎ² monomer after 7 d, indicating increased transport of AÎ² from the brain to the periphery. Enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in brain microvessels and the AÎ²-degrading protease neprilysin (NEP) occurred 14-21 d after a substantial decrease in brain AÎ² levels. However, significant increase in liver LRP and NEP occurred much earlier, at 7 d, and were accompanied by a rise in plasma sLRP, a peripheral sink for brain AÎ². In WT mice, the extract induced liver, but not brain, LRP and NEP and decreased plasma and brain AÎ², indicating that increase in liver LRP and sLRP occurring independent of AÎ² concentration could result in clearance of AÎ². Selective down-regulation of liver LRP, but not NEP, abrogated the therapeutic effects of the extract. The remarkable therapeutic effect of W. somnifera mediated through up-regulation of liver LRP indicates that targeting the periphery offers a unique mechanism for AÎ² clearance and reverses the behavioral deficits and pathology seen in Alzheimer's disease models.\",\n",

Oxo8dG was measured in nuclear DNA (nDNA) isolated from liver, heart, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, and spleen and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) isolated from liver. We observed a significant increase in oxo8dG levels in nDNA with age in all tissues and strains of rodents studied. The age-related increase in oxo8dG in nDNA from old mice was shown not to the result of the tissue's reduced ability to remove the oxo8dG lesion. Rather, the increase in oxo8dG levels appears to arise from an age-related increase in the sensitivity of these tissues to oxidative stress. We also observed an age-related increase in oxo8dG in mtDNA isolated from the livers of the rats and mice. Dietary restriction, which is known to retard aging and increase the lifespan of rodents, was shown to significantly reduce the age-related accumulation of oxo8dG levels in nDNA in all tissues of male B6D23F1 mice and in most tissues of male F344 rats. Our study also showed that dietary restriction prevented the age-related increase in oxo8dG levels in mtDNA isolated from the livers of both rats and mice.\",\n",

Recent studies have shown that nanoparticles can cross the placenta barrier in pregnant mice and cause neurotoxicity in their offspring, but a more detailed understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on pregnant animals remains elusive. Here, we show that silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles with diameters of 70 nm and 35 nm, respectively, can cause pregnancy complications when injected intravenously into pregnant mice. The silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles were found in the placenta, fetal liver and fetal brain. Mice treated with these nanoparticles had smaller uteri and smaller fetuses than untreated controls. Fullerene molecules and larger (300 and 1,000 nm) silica particles did not induce these complications. These detrimental effects are linked to structural and functional abnormalities in the placenta on the maternal side, and are abolished when the surfaces of the silica nanoparticles are modified with carboxyl and amine groups.',\n",

However, if and how chronic inflammation regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and alters ER homeostasis in general, or in the context of chronic disease, remains unknown. Here, we show that, in the setting of obesity, inflammatory input through increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity causes S-nitrosylation of a key UPR regulator, IRE1Î±, which leads to a progressive decline in hepatic IRE1Î±-mediated XBP1 splicing activity in both genetic (ob/ob) and dietary (high-fat diet-induced) models of obesity. Finally, in obese mice with liver-specific IRE1Î± deficiency, reconstitution of IRE1Î± expression with a nitrosylation-resistant variant restored IRE1Î±-mediated XBP1 splicing and improved glucose homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these data describe a mechanism by which inflammatory pathways compromise UPR function through iNOS-mediated S-nitrosylation of IRE1Î±, which contributes to defective IRE1Î± activity, impaired ER function, and prolonged ER stress in obesity.',\n",

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) may serve as a promising model to address the size-dependent biological response to nanoparticles because they show good biocompatibility and their size can be controlled with great precision during their chemical synthesis. Naked GNPs ranging from 3 to 100 nm were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/C mice at a dose of 8 mg/kg/week. GNPs of 3, 5, 50, and 100 nm did not show harmful effects; however, GNPs ranging from 8 to 37 nm induced severe sickness in mice. Mice injected with GNPs in this range showed fatigue, loss of appetite, change of fur color, and weight loss. Starting from day 14, mice in this group exhibited a camel-like back and crooked spine. The majority of mice in these groups died within 21 days. Injection of 5 and 3 nm GNPs, however, did not induce sickness or lethality in mice. Pathological examination of the major organs of the mice in the diseased groups indicated an increase of Kupffer cells in the liver, loss of structural integrity in the lungs, and diffusion of white pulp in the spleen. The pathological abnormality was associated with the presence of gold particles at the diseased sites, which were verified by ex vivo Coherent anti-Stoke Raman scattering microscopy. Modifying the surface of the GNPs by incorporating immunogenic peptides ameliorated their toxicity. This reduction in the toxicity is associated with an increase in the ability to induce antibody response. The toxicity of GNPs may be a fundamental determinant of the environmental toxicity of nanoparticles.',\n",

PBSF/SDF-1 stimulates proliferation of B-cell progenitors in vitro<SUP>6</SUP> and is constitutively expressed in bone-marrow-derived stromal cells<SUP>6,7</SUP>. Here we investigate the physiological roles of PBSF/SDF-1 by generating mutant mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding PBSF/SDF-1. We found that mice lacking PBSF/SDF-1 died perinatally and that although the numbers of B-cell progenitors in mutant embryos were severely reduced in fetal liver and bone marrow, myeloid progenitors were reduced only in the bone marrow but not in the fetal liver, indicating that PBSF/SDF-1 is responsible for B-cell lymphopoiesis and bone-marrow myelopoiesis. In addition, the mutants had a cardiac ventricular septal defect. Hence, we have shown that the chemokine PBSF/SDF-1 has several essential functions in development.',\n",

The rise in the incidence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, has renewed interest in interorgan communication. We used mouse models to explore the mechanism whereby obesity enhances pancreatic Î² cell mass, pathophysiological compensation for insulin resistance. We found that hepatic activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling induced pancreatic Î² cell proliferation through a neuronal-mediated relay of metabolic signals. This metabolic relay from the liver to the pancreas is involved in obesity-induced islet expansion. In mouse models of insulin-deficient diabetes, liver-selective activation of ERK signaling increased Î² cell mass and normalized serum glucose levels. Thus, interorgan metabolic relay systems may serve as valuable targets in regenerative treatments for diabetes.',\n",

We developed a method of Tetraplex-guide Tandem for construction of cosmids containing four and eight multiplex gRNA-expressing units in one step utilizing lambda in vitro packaging. Using this method, we produced an adenovirus vector (AdV) containing four multiplex-gRNA units for two double-nicking sets. Unexpectedly, the AdV could stably be amplified to the scale sufficient for animal experiments with no detectable lack of the multiplex units. When the AdV containing gRNAs targeting the H2-Aa gene and an AdV expressing Cas9 nickase were mixed and doubly infected to mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, deletions were observed in more than 80% of the target gene even using double-nicking strategy. Indels were also detected in about 20% of the target gene at two sites in newborn mouse liver cells by intravenous injection. Interestingly, when one double-nicking site was disrupted, the other was simultaneously disrupted, implying that two genes in the same cell may simultaneously be disrupted in the AdV system. The AdVs expressing four multiplex gRNAs could offer simultaneous knockout of four genes or two genes by double-nicking cleavages with low off-target effect.',\n",

We studied the antiviral potency of pegylated interferon-Î± (pegIFNÎ±) against HEV infections in humanized mice and modelled intrahepatic interferon stimulated gene (ISG) responses. Human gene expression levels in humanized mouse livers were analyzed by qPCR and Nanostring. Human CXCL10 was measured in mouse serum. HEV genotype 3 (gt3) infections were cleared from liver and feces within 8 pegIFNÎ± doses in all mice and relapsed after a single pegIFNÎ± injection in only half of treated animals. Rapid viral clearance by pegIFNÎ± was confirmed in HEV gt1, but not in Hepatitis B Virus infected animals. No ISG induction was observed in untreated HEV gt3 and gt1 infected humanized livers compared to control chimeric mice, irrespective of the human hepatocyte donor, viral isolate or HEV infection duration. Human specific ISG transcript levels in mouse liver increased significantly after pegIFNÎ± treatment and induced high circulating human CXCL10 in mouse serum. In conclusion, HEV gt1 and gt3 infections do not elicit innate intrahepatic immune responses and remain highly sensitive to pegIFNÎ± in immunocompromised humanized mice.',\n",

Old Sirt1-tg mice present lower levels of DNA damage, decreased expression of the ageing-associated gene p16<SUP>Ink4a</SUP>, a better general health and fewer spontaneous carcinomas and sarcomas.

The best available methods for liver humanization rely on cell transplantation into immunodeficient mice with liver injury but these methods have not gained widespread use due to the duration and variability of hepatocyte repopulation. In light of the significant progress that has been achieved in clinical cell transplantation through tissue engineering, we sought to develop a humanized mouse model based on the facile and ectopic implantation of a tissue-engineered human liver. These human ectopic artificial livers (HEALs) stabilize the function of cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes through juxtacrine and paracrine signals in polymeric scaffolds. In contrast to current methods, HEALs can be efficiently established in immunocompetent mice with normal liver function. Mice transplanted with HEALs exhibit humanized liver functions persistent for weeks, including synthesis of human proteins, human drug metabolism, drug-drug interaction, and drug-induced liver injury. Here, mice with HEALs are used to predict the disproportionate metabolism and toxicity of \"major\" human metabolites using multiple routes of administration and monitoring. These advances may enable manufacturing of reproducible in vivo models for diverse drug development and research applications.',\n",

We hypothesize that the 22:6 requirements of membranes (e.g., during synaptogenesis, photoreceptor membrane biogenesis, or repair after ischemic injury or neurodegenerative disorders) are met by a signal that is sent by the appropriate tissues to the liver to evoke the secretion of 22:6-containing lipoproteins.\",\n",

Mice were divided into 4 groups: P0 (given distilled water), P1, P2, and P3 were given Neem leaf extract with 8.4, 11.2 and 14 mg/KgBW/day respectively. Each treatment group had six replications. Treatment was given orally for 21 days. The body weight was measured every week until the end of treatment. The mice were anesthetized with chloroform at the end of treatment, continued by dissecting and isolating liver isolation. The isolated liver is then weighed to determine the HSI value. Data were analyzed with ANOVA followed by DMRT test. The results showed that the body weight of control group showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) to the treatment group.

This increased expression appears to be of pathogenic importance because transgenic mice overexpressing 11Î²-HSD1 selectively in adipose tissue exhibit a full metabolic syndrome with visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin-resistant diabetes, and hypertension. In this model, while systemic plasma GC levels are unaltered, GC delivery to the liver via the portal vein is increased. 11Î²-HSD1 is most highly expressed in liver where inhibition or deficiency of its activity improves glucose and lipid homeostasis. To determine the potential contribution of elevated intrahepatic GCs alone toward development of insulin-resistant syndromes we generated transgenic mice expressing increased 11Î²-HSD1 activity selectively in the liver under transcriptional control of hepatic regulatory sequences derived from the human apoE gene (apoE-HSD1). Transgenic lines with 2- and 5-fold-elevated 11Î²-HSD1 activity exhibited mild insulin resistance without altered fat depot mass. ApoE-HSD1 transgenic mice exhibited fatty liver and dyslipidemia with increased hepatic lipid synthesis/flux associated with elevated hepatic LXRÎ± and PPARÎ± mRNA levels as well as impaired hepatic lipid clearance. Further, apoE-HSD1 transgenic mice have a marked, transgene-dose-associated hypertension paralleled by incrementally increased liver angiotensinogen expression. These data suggest that elevated hepatic expression of 11Î²-HSD1 may relate to the pathogenesis of specific fatty liver, insulin-resistant, and hypertensive syndromes without obesity in humans as may occur in, for example, myotonic dystrophy, and possibly, the metabolically obese, normal-weight individual.',\n",

Several G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as free-fatty-acid receptors important in physiology as well as in several diseases. GPR120 (also known as O3FAR1) functions as a receptor for unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids and has a critical role in various physiological homeostasis mechanisms such as adipogenesis, regulation of appetite and food preference. Here we show that GPR120-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis. Insulin resistance in such mice is associated with reduced insulin signalling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In human, we show that GPR120 expression in adipose tissue is significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. GPR120 exon sequencing in obese subjects reveals a deleterious non-synonymous mutation (p.R270H) that inhibits GPR120 signalling activity. Furthermore, the p.R270H variant increases the risk of obesity in European populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that the lipid sensor GPR120 has a key role in sensing dietary fat and, therefore, in the control of energy balance in both humans and rodents.',\n",

The N-terminal 25-amino acid sequence of immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor was identical to the predicted mature N termini of two mouse genes related to human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and was strongly homologous to the N termini of members of the CEA family in humans and rats. Polyclonal antibodies to human CEA recognized the immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor and the MHV receptor in liver membranes and intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible mouse strains. In membranes from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the anti-CEA antibodies recognized a homologous glycoprotein that failed to bind MHV. The MHV receptor glycoprotein was detected in membranes of BALB/c colon, small intestine, and liver, which are the principal targets for MHV replication in vivo. The MHV receptor glycoprotein resembled members of the human CEA family in molecular weight, acidic pI, extensive glycosylation, solubility in perchloric acid, and tissue distribution. Thus, the MHV receptor is, to our knowledge, the first member of the CEA family of glycoproteins to be identified as a virus receptor.',\n",

One such example is ATP8B1, a P4-type ATPase disrupted in three inherited forms of intrahepatic cholestasis. Mutation of the X-linked mouse gene Atp11c, which encodes a paralogous P4-type ATPase, precludes B-cell development in the adult bone marrow, but also causes hyperbilirubinemia. Here we explore this hyperbilirubinemia in two independent Atp11c mutant mouse lines, and find that it originates from an effect on nonhematopoietic cells. Liver function tests and histology revealed only minor pathology, although cholic acid was elevated in the serum of mutant mice, and became toxic to mutant mice when given as a dietary supplement. The majority of homozygous mutant females also died of dystocia in a maternal genotype-specific manner. ATP11C therefore represents a multifunctional transporter, essential for adult B-cell development, the prevention of intrahepatic cholestasis, and parturition, and is a new candidate for genetically undiagnosed cases of cholestasis and dystocia in humans.',\n",

This conclusion is reinforced by the presence of a single C4 gene in the Syrian hamster. Most H-2 haplotypes, including those characterized by an undetectable C4-Slp protein, possess two C4 gene copies which, in contrast to the neighboring factor B, show a marked restriction site polymorphism.

It was observed that the use of DESs monomer significantly improveed the affinity of benzoylation imprinted monolith and increased the adsorption capacity. Under optimal conditions, the recovery and imprinting factor (IF) of the imprinted monolith for SGRGKbz can reach 93.0% and 10.58, respectively. The average recovery of SGRGKbz extracted from the spiked histone digestion solution can reach 88.4% (n = 5, RSD = 3.4%).

Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform have reduced body adiposity, increased energy expenditure, and up-regulated expression of several genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid Î²-oxidation in liver. The mechanisms by which SCD deficiency leads to these metabolic changes are presently unknown. Here we show that the phosphorylation and activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic sensor that regulates lipid metabolism during increased energy expenditure is significantly increased (â40%, P &lt; 0.01) in liver of SCD1 knockout mice (SCD1-/-). In parallel with the activation of AMPK, the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase at Ser-79 was increased and enzymatic activity was decreased (â35%, P &lt; 0.001), resulting in decreased intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA (â47%, P &lt; 0.001). An SCD1 mutation also increased AMPK phosphorylation and activity and increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Lower malonyl-CoA concentrations are known to derepress carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). In SCD1-/- mice, CPT1 and CPT2 activities were significantly increased (in both cases â60%, P &lt; 0.001) thereby stimulating the oxidation of mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA.

       "    'abstract': 'Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis of HBV-associated HCC involves both viral and host factors. The latter include a functionally inefficient CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T-cell response that fails to clear the infection from the liver but sustains a chronic necroinflammatory process that contributes to the development of HCC. According to this scenario, amelioration of immune-mediated chronic liver injury may prevent HCC. Because platelets facilitate immune-mediated liver injury by promoting the hepatic accumulation of virus-specific CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells, we evaluated the long-term consequences of antiplatelet therapy in an HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic immune-mediated necroinflammatory liver disease that progresses to HCC. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel during the chronic phase of the disease diminished the number of intrahepatic HBV-specific CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells and HBV-nonspecific inflammatory cells, the severity of liver fibrosis, and the development of HCC. Antiplatelet therapy improved overall survival without causing significant side effects. In contrast, the same antiplatelet regimen had no antitumor effect when HCC was induced nonimmunologically by chronic exposure to a hepatotoxic chemical. The unprecedented observation that antiplatelet therapy inhibits or delays immune-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis suggests that platelets may be key players in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver cancer and supports the notion that immune-mediated necroinflammatory reactions are an important cause of hepatocellular transformation during chronic hepatitis.',\n",

Plasma concentrations of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)âspecific phospholipase D1 (Gpld1), a GPI-degrading enzyme derived from liver, were found to increase after exercise and to correlate with improved cognitive function in aged mice, and concentrations of Gpld1 in blood were increased in active, healthy elderly humans.

Here we show that mice with an adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown adipose tissueâbrown especiallyâinto ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3â§ UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine.',\n",

MPs have been detected in oceans, rivers, sediments, sewages, soil and even table salts. MPs exposure on marine organisms and humans has been documented, but information about the toxicity of MPs in mammal is limited. Here we used fluorescent and pristine polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) particles with two diameters (5\\u2009Î¼m and 20\\u2009Î¼m) to investigate the tissue distribution, accumulation, and tissue-specific health risk of MPs in mice. Results indicated that MPs accumulated in liver, kidney and gut, with a tissue-accumulation kinetics and distribution pattern that was strongly depended on the MPs particle size. In addition, analyses of multiple biochemical biomarkers and metabolomic profiles suggested that MPs exposure induced disturbance of energy and lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress. Interestingly, blood biomarkers of neurotoxicity were also altered. Our results uncovered the distribution and accumulation of MPs across mice tissues and revealed significant alteration in several biomarkers that indicate potential toxicity from MPs exposure. Collectively, our data provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of MPs.',\n",

Therefore, the current study investigated the relationship between Factor D and hepatic lipid accumulation using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Factor D knockout (FD-KO) mice. Factor D deficiency downregulated expression of genes related to fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, Factor D deficiency reduced the expression of inflammatory factors (Tnf and Ccl2) and fibrosis markers and decreased accumulation of F4/80-positive macrophages.

It comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which differ markedly with regards to their morphology, metastatic potential and responses to therapy. However, the regulatory molecules and tissue context that commit transformed hepatic cells towards HCC or ICC are largely unknown. Here we show that the hepatic microenvironment epigenetically shapes lineage commitment in mosaic mouse models of liver tumorigenesis. Whereas a necroptosis-associated hepatic cytokine microenvironment determines ICC outgrowth from oncogenically transformed hepatocytes, hepatocytes containing identical oncogenic drivers give rise to HCC if they are surrounded by apoptotic hepatocytes. Epigenome and transcriptome profiling of mouse HCC and ICC singled out Tbx3 and Prdm5 as major microenvironment-dependent and epigenetically regulated lineage-commitment factors, a function that is conserved in humans. Together, our results provide insight into lineage commitment in liver tumorigenesis, and explain molecularly why common liver-damaging risk factors can lead to either HCC or ICC.',\n",

Previous studies on the genotoxicity of TiO2 have reported discrepant or inconclusive findings in both in vitro and in vivo systems. This study explores the in vivo genotoxic potential of a wellâcharacterized uncoated TiO2 NM with an average diameter of 22 nm (NMâ102, from JRC repository) using several genotoxicity endpoints in the LacZ plasmidâbased transgenic mouse model. Mice were exposed by intravenous injection to two daily doses of NMâ102: 10 and 15 mg/kg of body weight/day. Micronuclei were analyzed in peripheral blood reticulocytes 42 hr after the last treatment. DNA strand breaks (comet assay) and gene mutations were determined in the spleens and livers of the same animals 28 days after the last treatment. Histopathological and cytological analyses were also performed in liver samples. Genotoxic effects were not detected in mice exposed to the nanosized TiO2 under the experimental conditions used, despite a moderate inflammatory response that was observed in the liver. Considering the biopersistence of TiO2 in mouse liver and the moderate inflammatory response, the possibility of a secondary genotoxic effect at higher doses and in conditions that result in a stronger inflammatory response, for example, within a longer time window, should be investigated further.

In these mice, impairment of bile canalicular indicated by the loss of CD10 expression, down-regulation of bile salt transporters, increased total bile acid, and massive apoptotic and necrotic hepatocytes occurred with the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 3, resulting in reduced animal survival compared to wild-type mice.

However, it remains to be elusive whether TOCP induces liver injury. In this study, male mice were orally administered different concentrations of TOCP (100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. Histological examination showed that TOCP led to serious hepatocellular injury. In addition, administration of TOCP induced a marked elevation in the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in mice. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased significantly in the liver after the mice were treated with TOCP; while there was a dramatic decrease in the content of glutathione (GSH) and the activities of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). TOCP inhibited viability of mouse liver cancer Hepa 1-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TOCP significantly increased MDA content and inhibited GSH content and the activities of SOD and GSH-PX in the cells, respectively. Oxidative stress dramatically inhibited viability of Hepa 1-6 cells; while inhibition of oxidative stress by N-acetyl-l-cysteine could rescue the cell viability inhibited by TOCP to a certain extent.

Thus, we propose a structured illumination based FF-OCT(SI-FF-OCT) to realize three-dimensional sub-cellular resolution using parallel coded digital micromirror device (DMD). First, the principle of SI-FF-OCT was introduced in terms of point spread function (PSF) of the standard FF-OCT optical system. Second, a 1D illumination pattern of SI-FF-OCT for imaging random tissue was simulated for both of lateral resolution enhancement and optical sectioning capacity in the same configuration. The results of onion cells and mouse liver tissue suggested that the proposed white-light structured illumination approach in FF-OCT demonstrates tomographic imaging for thick transparent samples with a higher lateral resolution and better contrast than standard FF-OCT.

Here, we show that liver-specific ablation of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) disrupts the hepatic 12-hour clock and promotes spontaneous non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We show that hepatic XBP1 predominantly regulates the 12-hour rhythmicity of gene transcription in the mouse liver and demonstrate that perturbation of the 12-hour clock, but not the core circadian clock, is associated with the onset and progression of this NAFLD phenotype. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) binds to the hepatic 12-hour cistrome to directly regulate the 12-hour clock, with a periodicity paralleling the harmonic activation of the 12-hour oscillatory transcription of many rate-limiting metabolic genes known to have perturbations in human metabolic disease. Functionally, we show that Xbp1 ablation significantly reduces cellular membrane fluidity and impairs lipid homeostasis via rate-limiting metabolic processes in fatty acid monounsaturated and phospholipid remodeling pathways. These findings reveal that genetic disruption of the hepatic 12-hour clock links to the onset and progression of NAFLD development via transcriptional regulator XBP1, and demonstrate a role for XBP1 and the 12-hour clock in the modulation of phospholipid composition and the maintenance of lipid homeostasis.',\n",

Here, we employ an IBD-PSC mouse model to investigate the impact of colitis on bile acid metabolism and cholestatic liver injury. Unexpectedly, intestinal inflammation and barrier impairment improve acute cholestatic liver injury and result in reduced liver fibrosis in a chronic colitis model. This phenotype is independent of colitis-induced alterations of microbial bile acid metabolism but mediated via hepatocellular NF-ÎºB activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which suppresses bile acid metabolism in-vitro and in-vivo.

       "    'abstract': \"RNA interference (RNAi) holds considerable promise as a therapeutic approach to silence disease-causing genes, particularly those that encode so-called `non-druggable' targets that are not amenable to conventional therapeutics such as small molecules, proteins, or monoclonal antibodies. The main obstacle to achieving in vivo gene silencing by RNAi technologies is delivery. Here we show that chemically modified short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can silence an endogenous gene encoding apolipoprotein B (apoB) after intravenous injection in mice. Administration of chemically modified siRNAs resulted in silencing of the apoB messenger RNA in liver and jejunum, decreased plasma levels of apoB protein, and reduced total cholesterol. We also show that these siRNAs can silence human apoB in a transgenic mouse model. In our in vivo study, the mechanism of action for the siRNAs was proven to occur through RNAi-mediated mRNA degradation, and we determined that cleavage of the apoB mRNA occurred specifically at the predicted site. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of siRNAs for the treatment of disease.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'We used several of the genetic lesions commonly associated with human liver tumors to reconstruct genetic progression to hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma in mouse models. We initiated tumorigenesis with a transgene of the protooncogene MET or by hydrodynamic transfection of MET in combination with other genes into the livers of adult animals. Hepatocellular carcinoma in both instances arose from cooperation between MET and constitutively active versions of Î²-catenin. In contrast, adenomas were produced by cooperation between MET and defective signaling through the transcription factor HNF1Î±. Prompted by these findings, we uncovered a coincidence between activation of the protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by MET and activating mutations of Î²-catenin in a subset of human hepatocellular carcinomas. Inactivation of MET transgenes led to regression of hepatocellular carcinomas despite the persistence of activated Î²-catenin. The tumors eventually recurred in the absence of MET expression, however, presumably after the occurrence of one or more events that cooperated with activated Î²-catenin in lieu of MET. These results offer insight into hepatic tumorigenesis, provide mouse models that should be useful in the further study of hepatic tumorigenesis and for preclinical testing, and identify a subset of human hepatocellular carcinomas that may be susceptible to combination therapy directed against Met and the Wnt signaling pathway.',\n",

Here, using a kinome-centred CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen, we show that inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is synthetic lethal with lenvatinib in liver cancer. The combination of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and lenvatinib displays potent anti-proliferative effects in vitro in liver cancer cell lines that express EGFR and in vivo in xenografted liver cancer cell lines, immunocompetent mouse models and patient-derived HCC tumours in mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) by lenvatinib treatment leads to feedback activation of the EGFR-PAK2-ERK5 signalling axis, which is blocked by EGFR inhibition. Treatment of 12 patients with advanced HCC who were unresponsive to lenvatinib treatment with the combination of lenvatinib plus gefitinib (trial identifier NCT04642547) resulted in meaningful clinical responses. The combination therapy identified here may represent a promising strategy for the approximately 50% of patients with advanced HCC who have high levels of EGFR.',\n",

Ferroptosis is a novel iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that is closely associated with the accumulation of lipid peroxides, Fe2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we found that 1,3-DCP could induce mouse liver injury via ferroptosis. Administrating of C57BL/6J mice with 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg 1,3-DCP for 4 weeks via oral gavage, the data showed that 1,3-DCP exposure led to the pathological changes in mouse livers, remarkably induced accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Iron, reduction of glutathione (GSH), and changed in the expression of ferroptosis marker proteins glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4). Then, we also proved the results with HepG2 cells in vitro. The data showed that treatment 1,3-DCP significantly triggered the ferroptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we found that the ferroptosis-related signal pathways were significantly activated in mice livers and HepG2 cells in response to 1,3-DCP exposure. The data showed that 1,3-DCP induced ferroptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation into nuclear and thereby suppressing the expression of its downstream target proteins including GPX4, ferritin heavy chain (FTH), ferroportin (FPN), cystine/glutamate transporter xCT (SLC7A11), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Taken together, our findings confirmed that 1,3-DCP induced ferroptosis via the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in hepatocytes. Our works provide new toxicity mechanisms of 1,3-DCP with ferroptosis on hepatocytes injury.',\n",

We now report the isolation of cDNA clones representing three forms of 3 beta HSD from mouse Leydig cell and liver libraries. The three forms share significant identify but differ from each other by 5-10% within their coding regions. RNA that hybridizes to radiolabeled 3 beta HSD probes is present in the gonads, adrenal glands, liver, and kidneys of both sexes. Ribonuclease protection analysis using antisense probes derived from each of the three forms demonstrates that one form, 3 beta HSD I, is restricted to steroidogenic tissues. Two other forms, 3 beta HSD II and III, are expressed in liver and kidney but are not detected in steroidogenic tissues. A polyclonal antibody raised against the human placental form of 3 beta HSD recognizes a 42-kDa protein in gonadal and adrenal tissue and a 45-kDa protein in liver. The antibody recognizes a 42-kDa protein in kidney only weakly. 3 beta HSD enzyme activity is present in testicular, adrenal, hepatic, and renal tissue, with adrenal tissue possessing the highest specific activity. When expressed as total 3 beta HSD activity for whole organ mass, activity is greatest in the liver. The results demonstrate that the mouse liver is a significant site of 3 beta HSD activity and demonstrate the existence of multiple 3 beta HSD structural genes in the mouse.',\n",

AMPK phosphorylated proapoptotic caspase-6 protein to inhibit its activation, keeping hepatocyte apoptosis in check. Suppression of AMPK activity relieved this inhibition, rendering caspase-6 activated in human and mouse NASH. AMPK activation or caspase-6 inhibition, even after the onset of NASH, improved liver damage and fibrosis. Once phosphorylation was decreased, caspase-6 was activated by caspase-3 or -7. Active caspase-6 cleaved Bid to induce cytochrome c release, generating a feedforward loop that leads to hepatocyte death.

Here we show that type I isoform of neuregulin1 with an Î±-type EGF-like domain (Nrg1Î±) is the major isoform in mouse liver and regulates hepatic glucose production. Forced expression of Nrg1Î± in mouse liver enhanced systemic glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose production with reduced fasting blood glucose levels. Nuclear forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) and its downstream targets, PEPCK and G6Pase, were suppressed in liver and isolated hepatocytes by Nrg1Î± overexpression. In contrast, silencing of Nrg1Î± enhanced glucose production with increased PEPCK and G6Pase expressions in cAMP/dexamethasone-stimulated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, the recombinant Î±-type EGF-like domain of NRG1Î± (rNRG1Î±) stimulated the ERBB3 signalling pathway in hepatocytes, resulting in decreased nuclear FoxO1 accumulation via activation of both the AKT and ERK pathways. In addition, acute treatment with rNRG1Î± also suppressed elevation of blood glucose levels after both glucose and pyruvate challenge. Although a liver-specific deletion of Nrg1 gene in mice showed little effect on systemic glucose metabolism, these results suggest that NRG1Î± have a novel regulatory function in hepatic gluconeogenesis by regulating the ERBB3-AKT/ERK-FoxO1 cascade.',\n",

Each of these chemicals has been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals and, in addition, humans are regularly exposed to at least three of these compounds (ME, NDEA, EC) in foods. Although the source of adducts from AAF is not known, the aminofluorene (AF) adduct is present in humans. Plotted on the same graphs are either some doses from common foods (ME, NDEA, EC) or adducts (AF) on human haemoglobin, for perspective, with their thresholds for carcinogenesis in animals. Use of a linear scale when comparing doses administered to animals in studies of carcinogenicity with doses of those same chemicals to which humans are exposed does not provide useful, comparative information. On the other hand, the Rozman logarithmic scale for dose allows one to put these relative doses in perspective. It is also evident that forcing a linear extrapolation through the zero, zero origin does not agree with the experimental data. Further analyses for goodness of fit for these dose responses reveal that the dose response for three of these compounds (ME, NDEA, EC) appears to be linear with the logarithm of the dose. However, AAF appears to be linear with the logarithm of the dose for bladder, but not for liver. It is suggested that the high background incidence of tumours in the BALB/c StCrlfC3Hf/Nctr mouse liver may confound the interpretation of dose response from AAF carcinogenesis in mouse liver.',\n",

MicroRNAs are negative regulators of gene expression that have been implicated in many biological processes, including metabolism. Here we show that the Let-7 family of microRNAs regulates glucose metabolism in multiple organs. Global and pancreas-specific overexpression of Let-7 in mice resulted in impaired glucose tolerance and reduced glucose-induced pancreatic insulin secretion. Mice overexpressing Let-7 also had decreased fat mass and body weight, as well as reduced body size. Global knockdown of the Let-7 family with an antimiR was sufficient to prevent and treat impaired glucose tolerance in mice with diet-induced obesity, at least in part by improving insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle. AntimiR treatment of mice on a high-fat diet also resulted in increased lean and muscle mass, but not increased fat mass, and prevented ectopic fat deposition in the liver. These findings demonstrate that Let-7 regulates multiple aspects of glucose metabolism and suggest antimiR-induced Let-7 knockdown as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, our Cre-inducible Let-7-transgenic mice provide a unique model for studying tissue-specific aspects of body growth and type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The regulation of fat and glucose metabolism in the liver is controlled primarily by insulin and glucagon. Changes in the circulating concentrations of these hormones signal fed or starvation states and elicit counter-regulatory responses that maintain normoglycaemia. Here we show that in normal mice, plasma insulin inhibits the forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 by nuclear exclusion and that in the fasted (low insulin) state Foxa2 activates transcriptional programmes of lipid metabolism and ketogenesis. In insulin-resistant or hyperinsulinaemic mice, Foxa2 is inactive and permanently located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In these mice, adenoviral expression of Foxa2T156A, a nuclear, constitutively active Foxa2 that cannot be inhibited by insulin, decreases hepatic triglyceride content, increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, reduces glucose production, normalizes plasma glucose and significantly lowers plasma insulin. These changes are associated with increased expression of genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis and glycolysis. Chronic hyperinsulinaemia in insulin-resistant syndromes results in the cytoplasmic localization and inactivation of Foxa2, thereby promoting lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in the liver. Pharmacological intervention to inhibit phosphorylation of Foxa2 may be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes.',\n",

The lactonase reaction with l-gulono-Î³-lactone is the penultimate step in l-ascorbic acid (AA) biosynthesis, and the essential role of SMP30 in this synthetic process was verified here by a nutritional study using SMP30 knockout mice. These knockout mice (n = 6), fed a vitamin C-deficient diet, did not thrive; i.e., they displayed symptoms of scurvy such as bone fracture and rachitic rosary and then died by 135 days after the start of receiving the deficient diet. The AA levels in their livers and kidneys at the time of death were &lt;1.6% of those in WT control mice. In addition, by using the SMP30 knockout mouse, we demonstrate that the alternative pathway of AA synthesis involving d-glucurono-Î³-lactone operates in vivo, although its flux is fairly small.',\n",

The collection efficiency of the NDS port was measured with respect to those of the DS port as function of the imaging depth within a tissue-like optical phantom, for two high numerical aperture objectives. A NDS-to-DS collection ratio as high as about 30 was found for an imaging depth of 500 Î¼m, corresponding to four mean scattering paths of the collected photons within the turbid medium. Measurements were fully interpreted by Monte Carlo simulations of light scattering through the turbid medium and collection by the spatio-angular apertured DS and NDS ports.

Liver stages grow and ultimately produce thousands of first-generation merozoites, which initiate the erythrocytic cycles causing malaria pathology. Here, we present a Plasmodium protein with a critical function for complete liver stage development. UIS4 (up-regulated in infective sporozoites gene 4) is expressed exclusively in infective sporozoites and developing liver stages, where it localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Targeted gene disruption of UIS4 in the rodent model malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei generated knockout parasites that progress through the malaria life cycle until after hepatocyte invasion but are severely impaired in further liver stage development. Immunization with UIS4 knockout sporozoites completely protects mice against subsequent infectious WT sporozoite challenge. Genetically attenuated liver stages may thus induce immune responses, which inhibit subsequent infection of the liver with WT parasites.',\n",

Mature liver expresses MAT1A, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues and is induced during liver growth and dedifferentiation. To examine the influence of MAT1A on hepatic growth, we studied the effects of a targeted disruption of the murine MAT1A gene. MAT1A mRNA and protein levels were absent in homozygous knockout mice. At 3 months, plasma methionine level increased 776% in knockouts. Hepatic AdoMet and glutathione levels were reduced by 74 and 40%, respectively, whereas S-adenosylhomocysteine, methylthioadenosine, and global DNA methylation were unchanged. The body weight of 3-month-old knockout mice was unchanged from wild-type littermates, but the liver weight was increased 40%. The Affymetrix GENECHIP system and Northern and Western blot analyses were used to analyze differential expression of genes. The expression of many acute phase-response and inflammatory markers, including orosomucoid, amyloid, metallothionein, Fas antigen, and growth-related genes, including early growth response 1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, is increased in the knockout animal. At 3 months, knockout mice are more susceptible to choline-deficient diet-induced fatty liver. At 8 months, knockout mice developed spontaneous macrovesicular steatosis and predominantly periportal mononuclear cell infiltration. Thus, absence of MAT1A resulted in a liver that is more susceptible to injury, expresses markers of an acute phase response, and displays increased proliferation.',\n",

Here we have generated a conditional-knockout mouse model to study the functions of Cdk1 in vivo. Ablation of Cdk1 leads to arrest of embryonic development around the blastocyst stage. Interestingly, liver-specific deletion of Cdk1 is well tolerated, and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is not impaired, indicating that regeneration can be driven by cell growth without cell division. The loss of Cdk1 does not affect S phase progression but results in DNA re-replication because of an increase in Cdk2/cyclin A2 activity.

Wild-type (WT) and CSE knockout (CSE-KO) mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) were analyzed for liver morphological and biochemical changes.

Typical histological and biochemical changes of fatty liver disease were found in CSE-KO mice with damaged liver functions. The levels of plasma and liver triglyceride were significantly lower in HFD-fed CSE-KO mice than in HFD-fed WT mice. Moreover, the expression of nuclear receptors transcriptional factors, especially LXRÎ±, in the liver was decreased in both control diet- or HFD-fed CSE-KO mice. Decreased expression of CYP7A1, an LXRÎ± targeted gene, halted catabolism of cholesterol into bile and subsequently led to cholesterol accumulation in the liver and gall bladder.

The cloned mouse cDNA is 2459 base pairs long and is composed of an open reading frame encoding a 524-amino acid polypeptide that contains a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Homology at the amino acid level of the mouse placental ALP is 90% to the human liver isozyme but only 55% to the human placental counterpart.

       "    'abstract': 'The Î²-catenin mutation is frequently observed in hepatoblastoma (HB), but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling induces HB tumor formation is unknown. Here we show that expression of growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) depends on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in HB patients. GREB1 is localized to the nucleus where it binds Smad2/3 in a competitive manner with p300 and inhibits TGFÎ² signaling, thereby promoting HepG2 HB cell proliferation. Forced expression of Î²-catenin, YAP, and c-Met induces HB-like mouse liver tumor (BYM mice), with an increase in GREB1 expression and HB markers. Depletion of GREB1 strongly suppresses marker gene expression and HB-like liver tumorigenesis, and instead enhances TGFÎ² signaling in BYM mice. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides for GREB1 suppress the formation of HepG2 cell-induced tumors and HB-like tumors in vivo. We propose that GREB1 is a target molecule of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and required for HB progression.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a central role in the transcriptional response to changes in oxygen availability. Stability of HIFs is regulated by multi-step reactions including recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) in association with an E3 ligase complex. Here we show that pVHL physically interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN), displacing the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This results in HIF-Î± protein stabilization and activation of HIF target genes even in normoxia such as during adipocyte differentiation. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), an inhibitor of FASN expression, also inhibited HIF target gene expression in cultured cells and in mouse liver. Clinically, FASN is frequently upregulated in a broad variety of cancers and has been reported to have an oncogenic function. We found that upregulation of FASN correlated with induction of many HIF target genes, notably in a malignant subtype of prostate tumours. Therefore, pVHL-FASN interaction plays a regulatory role for HIFs and their target gene expression.',\n",

Here, we show that mice with a liver-specific deletion of the p85Î± regulatory subunit of PI3K (L-Pik3r1KO) exhibit a paradoxical improvement of hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Although PI3K enzymatic activity is diminished in L-Pik3r1KO livers because of a reduced level of regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI3K, insulin-stimulated Akt activity is actually increased. This increased Akt activity correlates with increased phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate levels which are due, at least in part, to diminished activity of the (3,4,5)-trisphosphate phosphatase PTEN. Thus, the regulatory subunit p85Î± is a critical modulator of insulin sensitivity in vivo not only because of its effects on PI3K activation, but also as a regulator of PTEN activity.',\n",

In the blood and central nervous system, for example, organ mass is determined primarily by growth-factor-regulated cell proliferation and apoptosis to achieve a final target size. Here, we report that the size of the mouse pancreas is constrained by an intrinsic programme established early in development, one that is essentially not subject to growth compensation. Specifically, final pancreas size is limited by the size of the progenitor cell pool that is set aside in the developing pancreatic bud. By contrast, the size of the liver is not constrained by reductions in the progenitor cell pool. These findings show that progenitor cell number, independently of regulation by growth factors, can be a key determinant of organ size.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Purpose: It is vital for astronauts to maintain the optimal alertness and neurobehavioral function. Among various factors that exist in the space flight and long-duration mission environment, gravity changes may probably an essential environmental factor to interfere with internal circadian rhythms homeostasis and sleep quality, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Mammals' biological clock is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and peripheral organs adjust their own rhythmicity with the central signals. Nevertheless the mechanism underlying this synchronizition process is still unknown. microRNAs (miRNAs) are about 19â¼22nt long regulatory RNAs that serve as critical modulators of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Recently, circulating miRNAs were found to have the regulatory role between cells and peripheral tissues, besides its function inside the cells. This study aims to investigate the regulatory signal transduction role of miRNAs between SCN and peripheral biological clock effecter tissues and to further decipher the mechanism of circadian disturbance under microgravity. Method: Firstly, based on the assumption that severe alterations in the expression of genes known to be involved in circadian rhythms may affect the expression of other genes, the labeled cDNA from liver and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of clock-knockout mice and control mice in different time points were cohybridized to microarrays. The fold change exceeding 2 (FC&gt;2) was used to identify genes with altered expression levels in the knockout mice compared with control mice. Secondly, male C57BL/6J mice at 8 weeks of age were individually caged and acclimatized to the laboratory conditions (12h light/dark cycle) before being used for continuous core body temperature and activity monitoring. The mice were individually caged and tail suspended using a strip of adhesive surgical tape attached to a chain hanging from a pulley. Peripheral blood and liver tissues collection were consecutively performed. Blood samples and liver tissues were collected from tail-suspended and control mice under LD 12:12h and DD conditions during the 12th, 13th and 14th testing days at 4h intervals. Melatonin and corticosterone in mice plasma at different time points were assayed. NIH-3T3 cells were plated in culture dish for 22h before the experiment. For ground-based simulation of weightlessness, the medium was exchanged with DMEM containing 50% horse serum to synchronization, after 2 h, this medium was replaced with DMEM and 10% FBS. Then, at various time point (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48h), cells were cultured on the roating clinostat at 30r/min. Total RNA was extracted from liver and NIH-3T3 cells and subsequently reverse-transcribed. The SYBR green I real-time quantitative PCR system was conducted to examine the mRNA expression level of clock, bmal1, per1, per2, cry1 and cry2 in mice and NIH-3T3 cells, respectively. Paired comparisons of the circadian genes expression between period, peak values, amplitude and mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) were examined for evidence of circadian variation using Chronos-Fit software in mice and Cosine analyses in NIH-3T3 cells. Statistical analysis: All numerical data were expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine time points differences in the study parameters. Statistical differences between two groups were determined by the Student's t test. Results: (1) Circadian rhythm of clock and bmal1 mRNA expression was found in each testing day with similar peak phase in both tail suspension group and control group. Compared with control group, tail suspension group showed that the peak phase of clock gene mRNA level advanced approximately 4 hours and the amplitude of bmal1 gene mRNA level significantly reduced at ZT2 and ZT6. (2) The expression of circadian genes in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that the maximum and minimum value of mRNA relative expression levels of clock and bmal1 during clinorotation were both found approximately at the time points 6h and 18h, respectively. The period length of experimental group was about 16h longer than control group. The peak phase and peak time of clock and bmal1 with simulated weightlessness group were ahead of control group. (3) At the Zeitgeber time 2 (ZT2), we found that 23 miRNAs in the SCN and 60 miRNAs in liver were significantly altered on the basis of an adjusted FC&gt;2 among 611 miRNAs. At the ZT14, 23 miRNAs in the SCN and 57 miRNAs in liver were altered compared with the control group (FC&gt;2). (a) Effects of clock knock out altered expression of miRNA. We analyzed the miRNA profile in SCN and liver of clock knonck out and WT mouse at two different time points using miRNA microarray. Of these, miR-122,miR-144, miR-210 and miR-669b at ZT2, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-429, miR-455, miR-669d and miR-96 at ZT14 were both changed in SCN and liver, respectively. Interestingly, the miR-122, a tissue specific miRNA of liver was also changed in SCN at ZT2. (b) Effects of light altered expression of miRNA: Light is an important environmental factors to regulate circadian genes expression. In clock mutant mice, all altered miRNAs except miR-144 were down-regulated in SCN while up-regulated in liver at ZT14 compared to ZT2. Interestingly, the miRNAs expression profiling in SCN and liver were opposite of WT mice at ZT14 compared to ZT2. (c) Effects of clock mutant on mRNA expression: To test whether the alteration in expression of miRNAs correlates with the gene expression pattern, cDNA microarray of SCN were assayed. The results revealed that the expression of nearly 1285 genes was altered substantially with at least 1 fold change absolute in the absence of clock. Among these altered genes, we chose the mRNAs with at least 4 fold changes to further study. Only 23 genes were altered in clock knockout compared with WT at ZT2, but 67 genes at ZT14. (d) Effects of light on mRNA expression. To evaluate the light effecting on genes expression in SCN, the cDNA microarrays in SCN at ZT2 and ZT14 were tested. 21 genes were over expression and 12 genes were down regulation ZT14 compared with ZT2 in WT. The number of altered genes in clock-/- mice was 67. (e) Direct interaction between altered miRNAs and mRNAs. To identify the interaction between regulatory miRNAs and altered mRNAs in the absence of clock, we predicted the target genes of miRNAs by TargetScan. The genes both the target genes of miRNAs and altered in cDNA microarray were unravelled. The exploration of functional interaction between miRNAs and clock genes mRNA is ongoing. Conclusion: Taken together, these results indicate that ground-based simulated weightlessness could alter the molecular biological rhythm patterns, which may preliminarily present the biological regulatory mechanism of circadian rhythm systems under spaceflight-related gravity. The potential underlying functional miRNAs could serve as targets to interfere with for interaction between central and peripheral circadian organs under simulated microgravity. This preliminary study may facilitate the exploration of circadian rhythm characteristics in space and the detailed process of signal transduction and circadian gene regulation.

Simultaneously, use of gastric acid suppressive medications is increasing. Here, we show that proton pump inhibitors promote progression of alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice by increasing numbers of intestinal Enterococcus spp. Translocating enterococci lead to hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte death. Expansion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis is sufficient to exacerbate ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Proton pump inhibitor use increases the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease among alcohol-dependent patients. Reduction of gastric acid secretion therefore appears to promote overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus, which promotes liver disease, based on data from mouse models and humans. Recent increases in the use of gastric acid-suppressive medications might contribute to the increasing incidence of chronic liver disease.',\n",

Pirfenidone (PFD) is an orally bioavailable pyridone derivative that has been clinically used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, it remains unknown whether PFD improves liver fibrosis in a mouse model with human NASH-like phenotypes. In this study, we employed melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice as a mouse model with human NASH-like phenotypes to elucidate the effect and action mechanisms of PFD on the development of NASH. PFD markedly attenuated liver fibrosis in western diet (WD)-fed MC4R-KO mice without affecting metabolic profiles or steatosis. PFD prevented liver injury and fibrosis associated with decreased apoptosis of liver cells in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice. Pretreatment of PFD inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±)-induced liver injury and fibrogenic responses associated with decreased apoptosis of liver cells in wild-type mice. PFD also prevented TNF-Î±-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro with reduced activation of caspase-8 and -3. This study provides evidence for the antifibrotic effect of PFD in a mouse model of human NASH. The data of this study highlight hepatocyte apoptosis as a potential therapeutic target, and suggest that PFD can be repositioned as an antifibrotic drug for human NASH.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. The development of much needed specific antiviral therapies and an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a convenient small animal model. The determinants restricting HCV tropism to human and chimpanzee hosts are unknown. Replication of the viral RNA has been demonstrated in mouse cells, but these cells are not infectable with either lentiviral particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) or HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc) (A.P., M.E. and C.M.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that there is a block at the level of entry. Here we show, using an iterative complementary DNA library screening approach, that human occludin (OCLN) is an essential HCV cell entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCVpp. Similarly, OCLN is required for the HCV-susceptibility of human cells, because its overexpression in uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCVpp uptake, whereas its silencing in permissive cells impaired both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. In addition to OCLN, HCVpp infection of murine cells required expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors CD81 (ref. 4), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI, also known as SCARB1) and claudin-1 (CLDN1). Although the mouse versions of SR-BI and CLDN1 function at least as well as the human proteins in promoting HCV entry, both OCLN and CD81 must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The species-specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second extracellular loop. The identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlights the importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process, and provides an important advance towards efforts to develop small animal models for HCV.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'To examine the amino acid sequence requirements for the biphasic association of Drosophila melanogaster apocytochrome c with mouse liver mitochondria in vitro, recombinant constructs of the protein were prepared. Removal of the C-terminal sequence to residue 58 had little influence, but truncation to residue 50 decreased the association to low levels and removal to residue 36 was even more effective. However, a mutant missing the segment between residues 35 and 66 was fully functional, but, when the C-terminal segment from residue 36 was replaced with a noncytochrome c sequence, the high-affinity phase of the association was lost. A mutant in which residues 90, 91, 92, 96, and 100 were replaced by lysine, leucine, proline, proline, and proline, respectively, to prevent the possible formation of the C-terminal alpha-helix and another mutant in which the C-terminal segment from residue 90 to residue 120 was a noncytochrome c sequence had normal association. In contrast, replacing lysine-5, -7, and -8 by glutamine, glutamic acid, and asparagine, respectively, resulted in loss of the high-affinity phase. The same mutations in the apoprotein lacking the segment between residues 35 and 66 caused, in addition, a decrease of the low-affinity phase association. Thus, the N-terminal region is most critical for apocytochrome c association, but alternative segments of the central and/or C-terminal region can be utilized, where noncytochrome c sequences are ineffective. These results emphasize the wide disparity between the structural requirements for association with mitochondria and for the production of a functional holoprotein.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Pollution by waste landfill leachate has prompted a number of studies on the toxic and potential health effects. This study assessed the genotoxicity of a municipal sludge leachate (MSL) in the somatic tissues (blood and bone marrow) and organs (liver, kidney, and spleen) of mice using the alkaline Comet assay. The possible cause of DNA damage via the study of antioxidant system (lipid peroxidation [LPO]; catalase [CAT]; reduced glutathione [GSH]; and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) responses in mouse liver was also investigated. Different concentrations (2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) of the leachate were administered intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days to male Swiss albino mice (4 mice/group). A significant ( p &lt; 0.05) increase in DNA damage in organs and tissues of treated mice compared to the negative control was observed as evident from the Comet assay parameters: olive tail moment (OTM, arbitrary units) and tail DNA (%). Bone marrow showed maximum DNA damage followed by liver &gt; spleen &gt; kidney &gt; blood as evident by the OTM. A significant increase ( p &lt; 0.05) in the level of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD) and LPO with a concurrent decrease in GSH in the liver of treated mice was also observed. Our finding demonstrates that the MSL induces DNA damage in the somatic tissues and organs of mouse as well as induces oxidative stress in the liver. These tissues and organs may be the potential targets in animal and human populations exposed to MSL. This is of relevance to public health; as such exposure could lead to adverse health effects via systemic genotoxicity.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A transgenic mouse strain that expresses the hepatitis B virus (HBV) large envelope protein in the liver was used to determine the extent of oxidative DNA damage that occurs during chronic HBV infection. This mouse strain develops a chronic necroinflammatory liver disease that mimics the inflammation, cellular hyperplasia, and increased risk for cancer that is evident in human chronic active hepatitis. When perfused in situ with nitroblue tetrazolium, an indicator for superoxide formation, the liver of transgenic mice displayed intense formazan deposition in Kupffer cells, indicating oxygen radical production, and S-phase hepatocytes were commonly seen adjacent to the stained Kupffer cells. Similar changes were not observed in nontransgenic control livers. To determine whether these events were associated with oxidative DNA damage, genomic DNA from the livers of transgenic mice and nontransgenic controls was isolated and examined for 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidatively modified adduct of deoxyguanosine. Results showed a significant, sustained accumulation in steady-state 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine that started early in life exclusively in the transgenic mice and increased progressively with advancing disease. The most pronounced increase occurred in livers exhibiting microscopic nodular hyperplasia, adenomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, HBV transgenic mice with chronic active hepatitis display greatly increased hepatic oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, the DNA damage occurs in the presence of heightened hepatocellular proliferation, increasing the probability of fixation of the attendant genetic and chromosomal abnormalities and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.\",\n",

SCD1 isoform plays a role in the regulation of energy metabolism and lipid synthesis, but the roles of the other SCD isoforms have not been investigated. Here we show that the SCD2 isoform is important in lipid synthesis in early development and is required for survival. SCD2-deficient (Scd2<SUP>-/-</SUP>) neonatal mice have a skin permeability barrier defect and a specific repartitioning of linoleic acid from epidermal acylceramide species into phospholipids. SCD2 expression is high in liver of wild-type mouse embryos and neonates between embryonic day 18.5 and 21 days of age and is decreased in adult mice. SCD1 expression, on the other hand, is induced after weaning. The liver, skin, and plasma triglyceride contents are decreased in the neonates but are not altered in the adult Scd2<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice. These results indicate that, although SCD1 expression is important in adult mice, SCD2 is crucial in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids that are required for maintaining normal epidermal permeability barrier function and biosynthesis of lipids during early skin and liver development.',\n",

Mutant IDH proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of multiple Î±KG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival, and extracellular matrix maturation<SUP>6,7,8,9,10</SUP>. However, the molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF-4Î±, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show an aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF-4Î± silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation, and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, IDH and Kras mutations, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs<SUP>4,5</SUP>, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations, hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel genetically engineered mouse model of IDH-driven malignancy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Genetically hypotransferrinemic mice accumulate iron in the liver and pancreas. A similar pattern of tissue iron accumulation occurs in humans with hereditary hemochromatosis. In both disorders, there is a decreased plasma concentration of apotransferrin. To test the hypothesis that nontransferrin-bound iron exists and is cleared by the parenchymal tissues, the tissue distribution of 59Fe was studied in animals lacking apotransferrin. Two groups of animals were used: normal rats and mice whose transferrin had been saturated by an intravenous injection of nonradiolabeled iron, and mice with congenital hypotransferrinemia. In control animals, injected 59Fe was found primarily in the bone marrow and spleen. In the transferrin iron-saturated animals, injected 59Fe accumulated in the liver and pancreas. Gastrointestinally absorbed iron in hypotransferrinemic or transferrin iron-saturated mice was deposited in the liver. This indicates that newly absorbed iron is released from mucosal cells not bound to transferrin. Clearance studies demonstrated that transferrin-bound 59Fe was removed from the circulation of rats with a half-time of 50 min. In transferrin iron-saturated animals, injected 59Fe was removed with a half-time of less than 30 s. Analysis of the distribution of 59Fe in serum samples by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of 59Fe not bound to transferrin. These results demonstrate the existence of and an uptake system for non-transferrin-bound iron. These observations support the hypothesis that parenchymal iron overload is a consequence of reduced concentrations of apotransferrin.',\n",

The Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway is activated in colon cancers and some melanoma cell lines, but has not yet been investigated in HCC. We have examined the status of the Î²-catenin gene in different transgenic mouse lines of HCC obtained with the oncogenes c-myc or H-ras. Fifty percent of the hepatic tumors in these transgenic mice had activating somatic mutations within the Î²-catenin gene similar to those found in colon cancers and melanomas. These alterations in the Î²-catenin gene (point mutations or deletions) lead to a disregulation of the signaling function of Î²-catenin and thus to carcinogenesis. We then analyzed human HCCs and found similar mutations in eight of 31 (26%) human liver tumors tested and in HepG2 and HuH6 hepatoma cells. The mutations led to the accumulation of Î²-catenin in the nucleus. Thus alterations in the Î²-catenin gene frequently are selected for during liver tumorigenesis and suggest that disregulation of the Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway is a major event in the development of HCC in humans and mice.',\n",

To define the role of EpoR in this process, the murine EpoR was disrupted by homologous recombination. Mice lacking the EpoR died in utero at embryonic day 11-12.5 with severe anemia. Embryonic erythropoiesis was markedly diminished, while fetal liver hematopoiesis was blocked at the proerythroblast stage. Other cell types known to express EpoR, including megakaryocytes, mast, and neural cells were morphologically normal. Reverse transcription-coupled PCR analysis of RNA from embryonic yolk sac, peripheral blood, and fetal liver demonstrated near normal transcripts levels for EKLF, thrombopoietin (Tpo), c-MPL, GATA-1, GATA-2, and alpha- and embryonic beta H1-globin but non for adult beta maj-globin. While colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colonies were not present in cultures derived from EpoR-/- liver or yolk sac cells, hemoglobin-containing BFU-E colonies were detected in cultures treated with recombinant Tpo and Kit ligand or with Tpo and interleukin 3 and 11. Rescued BFU-E colonies expressed adult beta-globin and c-MPL and appeared morphologically normal. Thus, erythroid progenitors are formed in vivo in mice lacking the EpoR, and our studies demonstrate that a signal transmitted through the Tpo receptor c-MPL stimulates proliferation and terminal differentiation of these progenitors in vitro.',\n",

This organ has a major impact on health and homeostasis during aging. The effects of life- and health-span-extending caloric restriction (CR) on gene expression among young and old mice and between long-term CR (LT-CR) and short-term CR (ST-CR) were examined. This experimental design allowed us to accurately distinguish the effects of aging from those of CR on gene expression. Aging was accompanied by changes in gene expression associated with increased inflammation, cellular stress, and fibrosis, and reduced capacity for apoptosis, xenobiotic metabolism, normal cell-cycling, and DNA replication. LT-CR and just 4 weeks of ST-CR reversed the majority of these changes. LT-CR produced in young mice a pattern of gene expression that is a subset of the changes found in old LT-CR mice. It is possible that the early changes in gene expression, which extend into old age, are key to the life- and health-span-extending effects of CR. Further, ST-CR substantially shifted the \"normo-aging\" genomic profile of old control mice toward the \"slow-aging\" profile associated with LT-CR. Therefore, many of the genomic effects of CR are established rapidly. Thus, expression profiling should prove useful in quickly identifying CR- mimetic drugs and treatments.',\n",

Human placental microsomes metabolized only OCBZ. Mouse liver microsomes metabolized CBZ to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E), 10- hydroxy-10,11-dihydro-carbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ), 3- hydroxy-carbamazepine (3-OH-CBZ), 10,11-trans-dihydroxy-10,11-dihydro-carbamazepine (10,11-D) and to an unidentified metabolite. CBZ-pretreatment of mice increased both ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in the liver and the amount of CBZ-E in microsomal incubations regardless of the age of mice. Human liver microsomes catalyzed the formation of CBZ to 9-hydroxymethyl-10-carbamoyl acridan (9-AC) in addition to CBZ-E, 3-OH-CBZ and 10-OH-CBZ. OCBZ was metabolized to its active metabolite in all incubations. An unknown metabolite was also present in some of the incubations. Human liver microsomes catalyzed only minute covalent binding of CBZ and OCBZ to DNA. Binding of OCBZ was, however, one order of magnitude greater than binding of CBZ. Human placental micro-somes from the mothers on CBZ therapy did not catalyze CBZ metabolism. The same microsomes catalyzed OCBZ metabolism to 10-OH-CBZ and to an unknown metabolite. These results indicate autoinduction in CBZ metabolism in mouse liver. Due to the higher binding of OCBZ than CBZ to DNA in vitro, further studies on the potential mutagenicity of OCBZ may be warranted.',\n",

We have been attempting to establish a nanomaterials safety-assessment system by using biomarkers to predict nanomaterial-induced adverse biological effects. Here, we focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) because of their tissue-specific expression and high degree of stability in the blood. We previously showed that high intravenous doses of silica nanoparticles of 70 nm diameter (nSP70) induced liver damage in mice. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of serum levels of liver-specific or -enriched miRNAs (miR-122, miR-192, and miR-194) with that of conventional hepatic biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) as biomarkers for nSP70. After mice had been treated with nSP70, their serum miRNAs levels were measured by using quantitative RT-PCR. Serum levels of miR-122 in nSP70-treated mice were the highest among the three miRNAs. The sensitivity of miR-122 for liver damage was at least as good as those of ALT and AST. Like ALT and AST, miR-122 may be a useful biomarker of nSP70. We believe that these findings will help in the establishment of a nanomaterials safety-assessment system.',\n",

Disruption of the Galectin-3 gene blocks myofibroblast activation and procollagen (I) expression in vitro and in vivo, markedly attenuating liver fibrosis. Addition of exogenous recombinant Galectin-3 in vitro reversed this abnormality. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis observed in the Galectin-3<SUP>-/-</SUP> mouse occurred despite equivalent liver injury and inflammation, and similar tissue expression of TGF-Î².

Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent, as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged environment. ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the transmembrane movement of substances. We found that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 is upregulated (messenger RNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in porphyrin transport. We also predicted that ABCB6 is functionally linked to haem biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in both human bone marrow and CD71<SUP>+</SUP> early erythroid cells (by database searching), and because our results show that ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver, and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. Here we demonstrate that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After ABCB6 is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin, mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis. This process is blocked when the Abcb6 gene is silenced. Our results challenge previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and the factors controlling haem biosynthesis.',\n",

However, the mechanism underlying the in vivo effects of MEQ on the liver, and whether the metabolic pathway of MEQ is altered in response to the pathophysiological conditions still remain unclear.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î³, a target of TZDs, is expressed abundantly in adipocytes, suggesting an important role for this tissue in the etiology and treatment of IR. Targeted deletion of PPARÎ³ in adipose tissue resulted in marked adipocyte hypocellularity and hypertrophy, elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids and triglyceride, and decreased levels of plasma leptin and ACRP30. In addition, increased hepatic glucogenesis and IR were observed. Despite these defects, blood glucose, glucose and insulin tolerance, and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake were all comparable to those of control mice. However, targeted mice were significantly more susceptible to high-fat diet-induced steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, and IR. Surprisingly, TZD treatment effectively reversed liver IR, whereas it failed to lower plasma free fatty acids.

       "    'abstract': 'In multicellular organisms, circadian oscillators are organized into multitissue systems which function as biological clocks that regulate the activities of the organism in relation to environmental cycles and provide an internal temporal framework. To investigate the organization of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues. We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control, which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental light cycle.',\n",

On the basis of both in vitro and in vivo toxicity none of the five species screened exhibited toxicity. 3 The toxicity of PCC 7820 was compared with a purified cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, Microcystin-LR.

Liquid-crystal order can serve this purpose. We computationally reconstructed 3D tissue geometry from microscopy images of mouse liver tissue and analyzed it using concepts from biaxial liquid crystal theory. We show that nematic apical and basal cell polarity axes of hepatocytes (the main cell type in the liver) follow long-range liquid-crystal order. These tissue-level patterns of hepatocyte cell polarity are co-aligned with a structural anisotropy of two transport networks, blood-transporting sinusoids and bile-transporting canaliculi that intertwine the tissue. Silencing communication from hepatocytes to sinusoids via Integrin-Î²1 knockdown disrupted both liquid-crystal order of hepatocytes and organization of the sinusoidal network, suggesting that bi-directional communication between hepatocytes and sinusoids orchestrates liver tissue architecture. Using a network generation algorithm, we computationally explore the resilience of anisotropic sinusoidal networks to local damage, thus addressing the link between form and function in a complex tissue with liquid-crystal order.',\n",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of VSG have remained elusive. According to our previous results, diet-induced obesity induces epigenetic modifications to chromatin in mouse liver. We demonstrate here that VSG in C57BL/6J wild-type male mice can reverse these chromatin modifications and thereby impact the expression of key metabolic genes. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, especially omega-6 fatty acid metabolism, are up-regulated in livers of mice after VSG while genes in inflammatory pathways are down-regulated after VSG. Consistent with gene expression changes, regulatory regions near genes involved in inflammatory response displayed decreased chromatin accessibility after VSG. Our results indicate that VSG induces global regulatory changes that impact hepatic inflammatory and lipid metabolic pathways, providing new insight into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial metabolic effects induced by VSG.',\n",

Male C57BL/6J mice were fed Amylin Liver NASH (AMLN) diet for 32 weeks. Animals with biopsy-confirmed steatosis and fibrosis received ALT-801, semaglutide, elafibranor, or vehicle daily for 12 weeks while maintained on the AMLN diet. Study endpoints included body and liver weight, liver and plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma aminotransferases, histological analysis of liver steatosis, inflammation (galectin-3) and fibrosis (collagen type 1 alpha 1), and evaluation of individual animal changes in composite Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score (NAS), and fibrosis stage. ALT-801 demonstrated significant reductions in body weight (approx. 25%), plasma aminotransferases, plasma total cholesterol and liver triglycerides/total cholesterol in conjunction with improved liver steatosis, with greater reductions (p &lt; 0.05) compared to semaglutide and elafibranor. ALT-801 significantly reduced the inflammation marker galectin-3 and the fibrosis marker collagen type 1 alpha 1 vs. vehicle (p &lt; 0.05), with ALT-801 producing greater reductions in galectin-3 vs. elafibranor (p &lt; 0.05).

Utilizing the viable yellow agouti (Avy) mouse, we examine the effects of developmental exposure through maternal diet to 50 ng BPA/kg (n = 14 litters), 50 Î¼g BPA/kg (n = 9 litters), or 50 mg BPA/kg (n = 13 litters) on global and candidate gene methylation at postnatal day 22. Global methylation analysis reveals hypermethylation in tail tissue of a/a and Avy/a offspring across all dose groups compared with controls (n = 11 litters; P &lt; 0.02). Analysis of coat color phenotype replicates previous work showing that the distribution of 50 mg BPA/kg Avy/a offspring shifts toward yellow (P = 0.006) by decreasing DNA methylation in the retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene (P = 0.03). Maternal exposure to 50 Î¼g or 50 ng BPA/kg, however, results in altered coat color distributions in comparison with control (P = 0.04 and 0.02), but no DNA methylation effects at the Agouti gene are noted. DNA methylation at the CDK5 activatorâbinding protein (CabpIAP) metastable epiallele shows hypermethylation in the 50 Î¼g BPA/kg offspring, compared with controls (P = 0.02). Comparison of exposed mouse liver BPA levels to human fetal liver BPA levels indicates that the three experimental exposures are physiologically relevant. Thus, perinatal BPA exposure affects offspring phenotype and epigenetic regulation across multiple doses, indicating the need to evaluate dose effects in human clinical and population studies.

       "    'abstract': 'It has been hypothesized that a major factor in the progression of mitochondrial disease resulting from defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the stimulation of the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resulting damage to the mtDNA. To test this hypothesis, we examined the mitochondria from mice lacking the heart/muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator (Ant1), designated Ant1<SUP>tm2Mgr</SUP> (-/-) mice. The absence of Ant1 blocks the exchange of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus inhibiting OXPHOS. Consistent with Ant1 expression, mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle, heart, and brain of the Ant1-deficient mice produced markedly increased amounts of the ROS hydrogen peroxide, whereas liver mitochondria, which express a different Ant isoform, produced normally low levels of hydrogen peroxide. The increased production of ROS by the skeletal muscle and heart was associated with a dramatic increase in the ROS detoxification enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Sod2, also known as MnSod) in muscle tissue and muscle mitochondria, a modest increase in Sod2 in heart tissue, and no increase in heart mitochondria. The level of glutathione peroxidase-1 (Gpx1), a second ROS detoxifying enzyme, was increased moderately in the mitochondria of both tissues. Consistent with the lower antioxidant defenses in heart, the heart mtDNAs of the Ant1-deficient mice showed a striking increase in the accumulation of mtDNA rearrangements, whereas skeletal muscle, with higher antioxidant defenses, had fewer mtDNA rearrangements. Hence, inhibition of OXPHOS does increase mitochondrial ROS production, eliciting antioxidant defenses. If the antioxidant defenses are insufficient to detoxify the ROS, then an increased mtDNA mutation rate can result.',\n",

Optimal mitochondrial function is ensured by a quality-control system tightly coupled to fusion and fission. In this connection, mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) participates in mitochondrial fusion and undergoes repression in muscle from obese or type 2 diabetic patients. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that Mfn2 plays an essential role in metabolic homeostasis. Liver-specific ablation of Mfn2 in mice led to numerous metabolic abnormalities, characterized by glucose intolerance and enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis. Mfn2 deficiency impaired insulin signaling in liver and muscle. Furthermore, Mfn2 deficiency was associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, enhanced hydrogen peroxide concentration, altered reactive oxygen species handling, and active JNK. Chemical chaperones or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin signaling in liver-specific Mfn2 KO mice. This study provides an important description of a unique unexpected role of Mfn2 coordinating mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum function, leading to modulation of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis in vivo.',\n",

Tissues analyzed contained histopathologic lesions including abnormal vacuolation, biliary proliferation, and, in many cases, hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas. Fibroblasts transfected with liver DNA samples from 7 of 13 diseased animals were effective in the induction of subcutaneous sarcomas in nude mice. Further analysis revealed the presence of flounder c-Ki-ras oncogenes in all 10 nude mouse subcutaneous tumors analyzed. Direct DNA sequencing and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization following amplification of the tumor DNA by the polymerase chain reaction showed mutations in the 12th codon in this gene. Analysis of DNA from all nude mouse tumors as well as the livers from which they were derived showed mutations at this codon. The mutations comprised G.C----A.T or G.C----T.A base changes resulting in substitution of serine, valine, or cysteine for glycine. Liver DNA samples from five histologically normal livers of animals from a less polluted site were ineffective in the transfection assay and showed only wild-type DNA sequences (GGT) at the 12th codon of c-Ki-ras. The prevalence of mutations in this gene region was associated with the presence of liver lesions and could signify DNA damage resulting from environmental chemical exposure.',\n",

It is well accepted that multiple parameters rather than a single readout parameter should be applied to describe animal distress or suffering. However, since the performance of readout parameters for animal distress is rarely defined and methods for multivariate analysis have only in rare cases been used, it is not known which methodology is most appropriate to define animal distress. This study used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to quantify the performance of burrowing activity, body weight change and a distress score of mice after induction of liver damage by bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride. In addition, Support Vector Machine classification was used to compare the distress of these mouse models. This approach demonstrated that bile duct ligation causes much more distress than carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. This study, therefore, provides a prototype how to compare two animal models by considering several readout parameters. In the future these or similar methods for multivariate analysis will be necessary, when assessing and comparing the severity of animal models.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The mammalian liver regenerates upon tissue loss, which induces quiescent hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle and undergo limited replication under the control of multiple hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Endocannabinoids acting via cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB<SUB>1</SUB>R) promote neural progenitor cell proliferation, and in the liver they promote lipogenesis. These findings suggest the involvement of CB<SUB>1</SUB>R in the control of liver regeneration. Here we report that mice lacking CB<SUB>1</SUB>R globally or in hepatocytes only and wild-type mice treated with a CB<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonist have a delayed proliferative response to two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHX). In wild-type mice, PHX leads to increased hepatic expression of CB<SUB>1</SUB>R and hyperactivation of the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the liver via an in vivo pathway involving conjugation of arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by fatty-acid amide hydrolase. In wild-type but not CB<SUB>1</SUB>R<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice, PHX induces robust up-regulation of key cell-cycle proteins involved in mitotic progression, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), cyclin B2, and their transcriptional regulator forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), as revealed by ultrahigh-throughput RNA sequencing and pathway analysis and confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Treatment of wild-type mice with anandamide induces similar changes mediated via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We conclude that activation of hepatic CB<SUB>1</SUB>R by newly synthesized anandamide promotes liver regeneration by controlling the expression of cell-cycle regulators that drive M phase progression.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells are generated. During embryonic development, these cells migrate through different organs until they reach the bone marrow, their definitive place in adulthood. Around E10.5, the fetal liver starts budding from the gut, where first hematopoietic cells arrive and expand. Hematopoietic cell migration occurs through cytokine stimulation, receptor expression, and glycosylation patterns on the cell surface. In addition, carbohydrates can modulate different cell activation states. For this reason, we aimed to characterize and quantify fetal megakaryocytic cells in mouse fetal liver according to their glycan residues at different gestational ages through lectins. Mouse fetuses between E11.5 and E18.5 were formalin-fixed and, paraffin-embedded, for immunofluorescence analysis using confocal microscopy. The results showed that the following sugar residues were expressed in proliferating and differentiating megakaryocytes in the fetal liver at different gestational ages: Î±-mannose, Î±-glucose, galactose, GlcNAc, and two types of complex oligosaccharides. Megakaryocytes also showed three proliferation waves during liver development at E12.5, E14.5, and E18.5. Additionally, the lectins that exhibited high and specific pattern intensities at liver capsules and vessels were shown to be a less time-consuming and robust alternative alternative to conventional antibodies for displaying liver structures such as capsules and vessels, as well as for megakaryocyte differentiation in the fetal liver.',\n",

Homozygous disruption of the VHL gene in mice results in embryonic lethality. To investigate VHL function in the adult we have generated a conditional VHL null allele (2-lox allele) and null allele (1-lox allele) by Cre-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells. We show here that mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele develop cavernous hemangiomas of the liver, a rare manifestation of the human disease. Histologically these tumors were associated with hepatocellular steatosis and focal proliferations of small vessels. To study the cellular origin of these lesions we inactivated VHL tissue-specifically in hepatocytes. Deletion of VHL in the liver resulted in severe steatosis, many blood-filled vascular cavities, and foci of increased vascularization within the hepatic parenchyma. These histopathological changes were similar to those seen in livers from mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele. Hypoxia-inducible mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin were up-regulated. We thus provide evidence that targeted inactivation of mouse VHL can model clinical features of the human disease and underline the importance of the VHL gene product in the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes in vivo.',\n",

A decline in skeletal muscle stem cell (satellite cell) activity due to a loss of Notch signalling results in impaired regeneration of aged muscle. The decline in hepatic progenitor cell proliferation owing to the formation of a complex involving cEBP-Î± and the chromatin remodelling factor brahma (Brm) inhibits the regenerative capacity of aged liver. To examine the influence of systemic factors on aged progenitor cells from these tissues, we established parabiotic pairings (that is, a shared circulatory system) between young and old mice (heterochronic parabioses), exposing old mice to factors present in young serum. Notably, heterochronic parabiosis restored the activation of Notch signalling as well as the proliferation and regenerative capacity of aged satellite cells. The exposure of satellite cells from old mice to young serum enhanced the expression of the Notch ligand (Delta), increased Notch activation, and enhanced proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, heterochronic parabiosis increased aged hepatocyte proliferation and restored the cEBP-Î± complex to levels seen in young animals. These results suggest that the age-related decline of progenitor cell activity can be modulated by systemic factors that change with age.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The rodent liver displays marked age- and sex-dependent changes in androgen sensitivity due to the sexually dimorphic and temporally programmed expression of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. We have altered this normal phenotype by constitutive overexpression of the rat AR transgene in the mouse liver by targeting it via the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) gene promoter. These transgenic animals in their heterozygous state produce an approximately 30-fold higher level of the AR in the liver as compared with the nontransgenic control. Androgen inactivation via sulfonation of the hormone by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (DST), an androgen-repressible enzyme, also contributes to the age- and sex-dependent regulation of hepatic androgen sensitivity. DST has a broad range of substrate specificity and is responsible for the age- and sex-specific activation of certain polycyclic aromatic hepatocarcinogens as well, by converting them to electrophilic sulfonated derivatives. In the transgenic female, the hepatic expression of DST was approximately 4-fold lower than in normal females, a level comparable to that in normal males. The hPAH-AR mice will serve as a valuable model for studying the sex- and age-invariant expression of liver-specific genes, particularly those involved in the activation of environmental hepatocarcinogens such as the aromatic hydrocarbons.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Many anticancer drugs are genotoxic agents inducing DNA breaks in actively proliferating cancer cells. However, these same drugs also induce mutations, mostly genome structural variations (GSVs). The detection of GSVs in normal cells and tissues is a major challenge due to the very low abundance of these mutations, which are essentially only detectable in clonal outgrowths, such as tumors. Previously we developed Structural Variant Search (SVS) - an NGS-based assay for the quantitative detection of somatic GSVs in normal cells. Using an improved version of SVS we now demonstrate that the same dose of the anti-cancer drug bleomycin induces about 5 times more somatic GSVs in quiescent primary human fibroblasts than in proliferating cells. GVS induction in non-dividing, normal cells was subsequently confirmed in vivo by demonstrating that a single dose of bleomycin leads to a significant increase of GSV frequency in mouse liver and heart, two postmitotic tissues. Our findings suggest that normal non-cycling differentiated cells may serve as a reservoir of iatrogenically induced mutations. These results provide more insight into the possible molecular mechanisms that underlie late-life morbidities in cancer survivors exposed to chemotherapy.',\n",

The reconstructed image suffers low contrast and degraded resolution due to the limited bandwidth and the spatial directivity of the transducer element. Here, we introduce a modified image deconvolution method with a hybrid reweighted adaptive total variation tailored to improve the image quality of OAT. The effectiveness and the parameter dependency of the proposed method are verified on standard test images. The performance of the proposed method in OAT is then characterized on both simulated phantoms and in vivo mice experiments, which demonstrates that the modified deconvolution algorithm is able to restore the sharp edges and fine details in OAT simultaneously. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the target structures in mouse liver and brain were improved by 4.90 and 12.69 dB, respectively. We also investigated the feasibility of using Fourier ring correlation (FRC) as an indicator of the image quality to monitor the deconvolution progress in OAT. Based on the experimental results, a practical guide for image deconvolution in OAT was summarized. We anticipate that the proposed method will be a promising post-processing tool to enhance the visualization of micro-structures in OAT.',\n",

Isolated liver mitochondria from these animals show no significant differences in rates of substrate-stimulated respiration, ADP-stimulated respiration and the respiratory control ratio (RCR), when compared with sea level controls. Undetectable or negligible differences in these parameters are also noted when sea level animals are exposed for one hour to severe hypoxia (7% O<SUB>2</SUB>). We therefore conclude that the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the isolated mouse liver mitochondria remains unaltered in both acute and chronic hypoxia. However the in vivo oxygen consumption by mice at this degree of hypoxia was markedly reduced. Lack of observable changes in oxidative phosphorylation could be accounted for by extracellular adaptations in mitochondria isolated from acclimatized animals. This explanation, however, is not consistent with the lack of changes on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria isolated from mice undergoing acute hypoxia at sea level. It is then suggested that isolated mitochondrial preparations are of limited value for investigating biochemical mechanisms underlying the variation of cellular respiration occurring in vivo.',\n",

The micronucleus and UDS assays were conducted using a single administration of MCP at its maximum tolerated dose, while the transgenic assays were conducted using nine daily administrations of MCP at its cancer bioassay dose level. These nine daily administrations were shown to double the weight of the liver of non-transgenic, Big Blueâ¢ and Mutaâ¢ Mice, as well as leading to a dramatic proliferation of peroxisomes (electron microscopy) in the livers of each strain. These changed parameters had returned to control levels when the mutation analyses were conducted (10 days after the final dose of MCP). Despite the liver enlargement observed following MCP administration, no evidence of mitotic activity was observed in treated livers, although an increased number of cells were undergoing replicative DNA synthesis during the final 3 days of the 9 days of administration (BUdR assessment of S-phase). Liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, AP, CK, GGT and albumin) were unaffected by the chronic (9 day) administration of MCP indicating an absence of hepatic toxicity, These combined observations favour a non-genotoxic mechanism of action for the hepatic carcinogenicity of MCP.

Our findings link cytolytic E. faecalis with more severe clinical outcomes and increased mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

       "    'abstract': 'The prevalent use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) has increased our exposure to these particles. The current available analytical techniques fail to simultaneously quantify and analyze the physical properties of ENPs in biological tissues. Therefore, new methods are required to evaluate the exposure conditions to ENPs. Single particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) is an attractive approach that can perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of ENPs. However, the application of this approach for biological samples is limited because of the lack of pretreatment methods for effectively recovering ENPs from biological tissues. In this study, we evaluated various pretreatment methods and identified the optimal pretreatment conditions for sp-ICP-MS analyses of ENPs in biological tissues using silver nanoparticles (nAg) as a model. We screened five reagents as pretreatment solvents (sodium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and proteinase K). Our results showed that treatment with sodium hydroxide was optimal for detecting nAg in the mouse liver. Moreover, this pretreatment method can be applied to other organs, such as the heart, lung, spleen, and kidney. Finally, we evaluated the applicability of this method by analyzing the quantity and physical properties of silver in the mouse blood and liver, after intravenous administration of nAg or silver ion. Our sp-ICP-MS method revealed that nAg administered into the blood was partially ionized and tended to be distributed in the particle form (approximately 80%) in the liver and in ionic form (approximately 95%) in the blood. In conclusion, we optimized pretreatment strategies for sp-ICP-MS evaluation of ENPs in biological tissues and demonstrated its applicability by evaluating the changes in the physical properties of nAg in the liver and blood. We also showed that partial changes from the particle form to the ionic form of nAg influences their kinetics and distribution when administered to mice.',\n",

SOCS-1 transcription is induced by cytokines, and the protein binds and inhibits Janus kinases and reduces cytokine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and the gp130 component of the interleukin 6 receptor. Thus, SOCS-1 forms part of a feedback loop that modulates signal transduction from cytokine receptors. To examine the role of SOCS-1 in vivo, we have used gene targeting to generate mice lacking this protein. SOCS-1<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice exhibited stunted growth and died before weaning with fatty degeneration of the liver and monocytic infiltration of several organs. In addition, the thymus of SOCS-1<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice was reduced markedly in size, and there was a progressive loss of maturing B lymphocytes in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood.

Phage M13mp18 DNA as a test molecule devoid of homology to mouse DNA was pipette-fed to or added to the food supply of mice. The fate of this foreign DNA in the animals was followed by several methods. In 84 animals, fragments of M13mp18 DNA were detected in the contents of the small intestine, the cecum (until 18 h), the large intestine, or the feces. In 254 animals, M13mp18 DNA fragments of up to 976 bp were found in blood 2-8 h after feeding. In buffer-fed control animals, M13mp18 DNA could not be detected. M13mp18 DNA fragments were traced by PCR in peripheral leukocytes and located by fluorescent in situ hybridization in about 1 of 1000 white cells between 2 and 8 h, and in spleen or liver cells up to 24 h after feeding, but not later. M13mp18 DNA could be traced by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the columnar epithelial cells, in the leukocytes in Peyer's patches of the cecum wall, in liver cells, and in B cells, T cells, and macrophages from spleen. These findings suggest transport of foreign DNA through the intestinal wall and Peyer's patches to peripheral blood leukocytes and into several organs. Upon extended feeding, M13mp18 DNA could be recloned from total spleen DNA into a Î» vector. Among about 2.5 Ã 10<SUP>7</SUP> Î» plaques, one plaque was isolated that contained a 1299 nucleotide pair fragment (nt 4736-6034) of sequence-identified M13mp18 DNA.

The DNA from another Î» plaque also contained mouse DNA, bacterial DNA, and rearranged Î» DNA. Two additional plaques contained M13mp18 DNA fragments of at least 641 (nt 2660-3300) or 794 (nt 4640-5433) nucleotide pairs.

       "    'abstract': \"Upon the aberrant activation of oncogenes, normal cells can enter the cellular senescence program, a state of stable cell-cycle arrest, which represents an important barrier against tumour development in vivo. Senescent cells communicate with their environment by secreting various cytokines and growth factors, and it was reported that this `secretory phenotype' can have pro- as well as anti-tumorigenic effects. Here we show that oncogene-induced senescence occurs in otherwise normal murine hepatocytes in vivo. Pre-malignant senescent hepatocytes secrete chemo- and cytokines and are subject to immune-mediated clearance (designated as `senescence surveillance'), which depends on an intact CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response. Impaired immune surveillance of pre-malignant senescent hepatocytes results in the development of murine hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), thus showing that senescence surveillance is important for tumour suppression in vivo. In accordance with these observations, ras-specific Th1 lymphocytes could be detected in mice, in which oncogene-induced senescence had been triggered by hepatic expression of Nras<SUP>G12V</SUP>. We also found that CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells require monocytes/macrophages to execute the clearance of senescent hepatocytes. Our study indicates that senescence surveillance represents an important extrinsic component of the senescence anti-tumour barrier, and illustrates how the cellular senescence program is involved in tumour immune surveillance by mounting specific immune responses against antigens expressed in pre-malignant senescent cells.\",\n",

To determine insulin action in vivo, we also measured whole-body insulin-stimulated liver and muscle glucose metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in Acc2<SUP>-/-</SUP> and WT control mice fed a high-fat diet. Contrary to previous studies that have suggested that increased fat oxidation might result in lower glucose oxidation, both fat and carbohydrate oxidation were simultaneously increased in Acc2<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice. This increase in both fat and carbohydrate oxidation resulted in an increase in total energy expenditure, reductions in fat and lean body mass and prevention from diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, Acc2<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice were protected from fat-induced peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance. These improvements in insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism were associated with reduced diacylglycerol content in muscle and liver, decreased PKCÎ¸ activity in muscle and PKCÎµ activity in liver, and increased insulin-stimulated Akt2 activity in these tissues.

We investigated how the mechanical properties of their substrates affect the formation of capillary-like structures and how they relate to the progression of angiogenesis during liver fibrosis. Differences in cell response in the FÎ¼Ns were synonymous of the early and late stages of liver fibrosis. The stiffness of the early-stage FÎ¼Ns was significantly elevated due to condensation of collagen fibrils induced by angiogenesis, and led to activation of HSCs by LSECs. We utilized these FÎ¼Ns to understand the response to anti-angiogenic drugs, and it was evident that these drugs were effective only for early-stage liver fibrosis in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model of liver fibrosis. Late-stage liver fibrosis was not reversed following treatment with anti-angiogenic drugs but rather with inhibitors of collagen condensation.

In addition, measurement of Sâphase synthesis (SPS) provides an indirect indicator of hepatocellular proliferation, which may be an important mechanism in rodent carcinogenesis. This assay was used to examine 24 chemicals for their ability to induce unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) or SPS in Fischerâ344 rats or B6C3F1 mice following in vivo treatment. Hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion and incubated with 3Hâthymidine following in vivo treatment by gavage. UDS was measured by quantitative autoradiography as net grains/ nucleus (NG). Controls from both sexes of both species yielded &lt;0.0 NG. Chemicals chosen for testing were from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) genetic toxicology testing program and most were also evaluated in longâterm animal studies conducted by the NTP. 11âAminounâdecanoic acid, benzyl acetate, bis(2âchloroâ1âmethylethyl)ether (BCMEE), C.I.

BCMEE, bromoform, chloroform, PBB, 1,1,2âtrichloroethane, and trichloroethylene were all potent inducers of SPS in mouse liver, while C.I. Solvent Yellow 14, and 1,1,2,2âtetrachloroethane yielded equivocal SPS results in rat and mouse, respectively. These results indicate that most of the test compounds do not induce UDS in the liver; however, the significant Sâphase response induced by many of these compounds, especially the halogenated solvents, may be an important mechanism in their hepatocarcinogenicity.\",\n",

We systemically integrated in vivo phenotyping with gene expression, biochemical analysis, and metabolomics, thereby identifying a distinguishing metabolic footprint of aging. Among the affected pathways in both liver and muscle we found glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and redox homeostasis. These alterations translated in decreased long chain acylcarnitines and increased free fatty acid levels and a marked reduction in various amino acids in the plasma of aged mice.

       "    'abstract': '2(3)-tert-Butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA) is one of several widely used antioxidant food additives that protect against chemical carcinogenesis and toxicity. The present report concerns the enhancement of dicoumarol-inhibited NAD(P)H:quinone reductase [NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone); NAD(P)H:(quinone acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2] activity in mouse tissues in response to dietary administration of BHA. Cytosolic quinone reductase specific activity was increased significantly in 10 of 15 tissues examined from BHA-fed mice. The greatest proportionate increase, to 10 times control levels, was observed in liver. BHA also increased the quinone reductase activities of kidney, lung, and the mucosa of the upper small intestine severalfold. The increases of quinone reductase activities in liver and digestive tissues in response to BHA were comparable to the increases previously observed in glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) and epoxide hydratase (EC 3.3.2.3) activities. Quinones are among the toxic products of oxidative metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons. NAD(P)H:quinone reductase exhibits broad specificity for structurally diverse hydrophobic quinones and may facilitate the microsomal metabolism of quinones to readily excreted conjugates. The protective effects of BHA appear to be due, at least in part, to the ability of this antioxidant to increase the activities in rodent tissues of several enzymes involved in the nonoxidative metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics.',\n",

Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) is the major enzyme of tryptophan catabolism and is abnormally expressed in liver cancer, but the function of TDO2 in NAFLD remains unclear. The current study was designed to probe into the effect and mechanism of TDO2 on NAFLD. <P />Methods. C57BL/6 mice and TDO2-knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 16 weeks to construct the NAFLD model in vivo; primary hepatocytes isolated from TDO2-KO mice were exposed to palmitate (PA) to establish the NAFLD model in vitro. The expression of TDO2 was determined using Western blot. The function and mechanism of TDO2 were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin-eosin staining, Oil Red O staining, immunohistochemical assay, and Western blot. <P />Results. The expression of TDO2 in the liver tissue of NAFLD mice was more than three times that in the control group. Functionally, TDO2 knockout reduced hepatic lipid deposition and liver fibrosis in NAFLD mice in vivo and primary hepatocytes induced by 200 Î¼M PA in vitro. Mechanistically, the loss of TDO2 restrained hepatic lipid deposition and expression levels of fibrosis-related markers in PA-treated primary hepatocytes, and these trends were partially reversed by 10 ng/ml receptor activator of the nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL, an activator of the NF-ÎºB pathway). <P />Conclusion. Knocking out TDO2 repressed hepatic lipid deposition and liver fibrosis in mice with NAFLD, and reduced hepatic lipid deposition and expressions of fibrosis-related markers in PA-treated primary hepatocytes by inactivating the NF-ÎºB pathway.',\n",

Although all the RNA samples examined contained class-alpha GT mRNA, class-mu GT mRNA was found only in individuals whose peripheral leukocytes expressed GT activity on the substrate trans-stilbene oxide. The mouse class-mu cDNA clone was used to identify a human class-mu GT cDNA clone, lambda GTH411. The amino acid sequence of the GT encoded by lambda GTH411 is identical with the 23 residues determined for the human liver GT-mu isoenzyme and shares 76-81% identity with mouse and rat class-mu GT isoenzymes. The mouse and human class-mu GT cDNA inserts hybridize with multiple BamHI and EcoRI restriction fragments in the human genome. One of these hybridizing fragments is missing in the DNA of individuals who lack GT activity on trans-stilbene oxide. Hybridizations with nonoverlapping subfragments of lambda GTH411 suggest that there are at least three class-mu genes in the human genome. One of these genes appears to be deleted in individuals lacking GT activity on trans-stilbene oxide.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"A specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of recombinant rat, mouse, and human Î³ -interferon (Î³ IFN) on the course of sporozoite-induced malaria infections. In mice and rats infected with sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei, mouse and rat Î³ -IFN's strongly inhibited the development of the exoerythrocytic forms in the liver cells of the hosts, but not the development of the erythrocytic stages. The degree of inhibition of the exoerythrocytic forms was proportional to the dose of Î³ -IFN administered, but was independent of the number of sporozoites used for challenge. A 30 percent reduction in the development of exoerythrocytic forms in rat liver was achieved when 150 units (about 15 nanograms of protein) of rat Î³ -IFN were injected a few hours before sporozoite challenge; the reduction was 90 percent or more with higher doses of Î³ -IFN. The effect was less pronounced if the Î³ -IFN was administered 18 hours before or a few hours after challenge. Human Î³ -IFN also diminished the parasitemia in chimpanzees infected with sporozoites of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The target of Î³ -IFN activity may be the infected hepatocytes themselves, as shown by in vitro experiments in which small doses of the human lymphokine inhibited the development of exoerythrocytic forms of Plasmodium berghei in a human hepatoma cell line. These results suggest that immunologically induced interferon may be involved in controlling malaria infection under natural conditions.\",\n",

Protein profiling by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed changes in the number and accumulation of protein spots in liver of mice treated with different concentrations of MCYST-RR. Untreated (control) mice liver showed 368 protein spots while the number was 355, 348 and 332 in liver of mice treated with 200, 300 and 400 Âµg kg body wt<SUP>-1</SUP> of MCYST-RR respectively.

Eighteen differentially accumulated proteins present in all the four conditions were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Of these eighteen proteins, 12 appeared to be involved in apoptosis/toxicological manifestations. Pathway analysis by Reactome and PANTHER database also mapped the identified proteins to programmed cell death/apoptosis clade. That MCYST-RR induces apoptosis in liver tissues was also confirmed by DNA fragmentation assay. Results of this study elucidate the proteomic basis for the hepatotoxicity of MCYST-RR which is otherwise poorly understood till date.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Liver X receptors (LXRÎ± and -Î²) are nuclear receptors abundant in the liver where they are regulators of lipid homeostasis. Both LXRs are also expressed in the brain, but their roles in this tissue remain to be clarified. We examined the brains of mice in which the genes of both LXRÎ± and -Î² have been disrupted and found several severe abnormalities. One of the most striking features is that the lateral ventricles are closed and lined with lipid-laden cells. In addition, there are enlarged brain blood vessels, especially in the pars reticularis of the substantia nigra and in the globus pallidus. Other features of the brains are excessive lipid deposits, proliferation of astrocytes, loss of neurons, and disorganized myelin sheaths. Electron micrographs revealed that, as mice aged, lipid vacuoles accumulated in astrocytes surrounding blood vessels. Comparison of mRNA profiles in LXR knockout mice and wild-type littermates showed that expression of several LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux from astrocytes was reduced. These findings show that LXRs have an important function in lipid homeostasis in the brain, and that loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative diseases. Further characterization of the role of LXRs in the brain could lead to new insights into the etiology and treatment of some neurodegenerative disorders.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Objective. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory liver disease. Intestinal flora disturbance in AIH is closely related to TFH/TFR cell imbalances. As a new method of microbial therapy, the role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in AIH remains elusive. Here, we attempted to verify the functional role and molecular mechanism of FMT in AIH. <P />Methods. An experimental autoimmune hepatitis (EAH) mouse model was established to mimic the characteristics of AIH. H&amp;E staining was used to detect histological features in mouse liver tissues. Serological tests were employed to identify several liver function biomarkers. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the status of TFH/TFR cell subsets. Western blotting was used to evaluate TLR pathway-associated protein abundance. RTâqPCR was applied to evaluate Treg cell markers and inflammation marker levels in mouse liver tissues. <P />Results. There was significant liver inflammation and dysregulated TFR/TFH cells with elevated levels of liver inflammation-associated biomarkers in EAH mice. Interestingly, transferring therapeutic FMT into EAH mice dramatically reduced liver injury and improved the imbalance between splenic TFR and TFH cells. FMT treatment also reduced elevated contents of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) in EAH mice. Furthermore, therapeutic FMT reversed the increased levels of IL-21 while promoting IL-10 and TGF-Î² cytokines. Mechanistically, FMT regulated TFH cell response in EAH mice in a TLR4/11/MyD88 pathway-dependent manner. <P />Conclusion. Our findings demonstrated that liver injury and dysregulation between TFR and TFH cells in EAH might be reversed by therapeutic FMT via the TLR4/11-MyD88 signaling pathway.',\n",

Recently, we reported that TiO2 NPs exhibit no genotoxic effects in the liver and erythrocytes during a relatively brief period following intravenous injection into mice. However, there is no information about long-term genotoxicity due to TiO2 NP accumulation in tissues. In this study, we investigated the long-term mutagenic effects of TiO2 NPs and the localization of residual TiO2 NPs in mouse liver after multiple intravenous injections.

The long-term mutagenic effects on the liver were analyzed using gpt and Spiâ mutation assays 90 days after the final injection. We also quantified the amount of titanium in the liver using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and observed the localization of TiO2 NPs in the liver using transmission electron microscopy. Although TiO2 NPs were found in the liver cells, the gpt and Spiâ mutation frequencies in the liver were not significantly increased by the TiO2 NP administration.

In this study, a powdery medical adhesive composed of aldehyded dextran and É-poly (L-lysine) was used with the recombinant batroxobin. Batroxobin is a venomous component from the snake Bothrops atrox moojeni and catalyzes fibrinogen conversion to form soluble fibrin clots. This research aims to examine the performance of the batroxobin-containing adhesive for hemostasis, and evaluate its potential as a novel hemostatic adhesive. The fibrinogen conversion ability of batroxobin was evaluated by a fibrinogen clotting assay and a whole blood clotting assay. Both experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the batroxobin-containing adhesive for blood clot formation. Animal experiments were also conducted. After a pricking wound was made in an ICR (imprinting control region) mouse liver, the adhesive and various concentrations of batroxobin were applied. The total amount of blood loss was reduced with increasing concentrations of batroxobin. For excessive bleeding conditions, the femoral artery wound model of SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats was adopted. With higher concentrations of batroxobin, hemostasis was more rapidly achieved. Histological analysis of the liver model also supports the hemostatic effects through fibrin clot formation. In conclusion, batroxobin and medical adhesive effectively facilitate blood coagulation, and could be developed for clinical use.',\n",

It has been reported that vildagliptin can cause hepatic dysfunction in patients. However, the molecular-mechanism of vildagliptin-induced liver dysfunction has not been elucidated. In this study, we employed an expression microarray to determine hepatic genes that were highly regulated by vildagliptin in mice. We found that pro-inflammatory S100 calcium-binding protein (S100) a8 and S100a9 were induced more than 5-fold by vildagliptin in the mouse liver. We further examined the effects of vildagliptin and its major metabolite M20.7 on the mRNA expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in human hepatoma HepG2 and leukemia HL-60 cells. In HepG2 cells, vildagliptin, M20.7, and sitagliptin - another DPP-4 inhibitor - induced S100A9 mRNA. In HL-60 cells, in contrast, S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs were significantly induced by vildagliptin and M20.7, but not by sitagliptin. The release of S100A8/A9 complex in the cell culturing medium was observed in the HL-60 cells treated with vildagliptin and M20.7. Therefore, the parental vildagliptin- and M20.7-induced release of S100A8/A9 complex from immune cells, such as neutrophils, might be a contributing factor of vildagliptin-associated liver dysfunction in humans.',\n",

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins. Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting.',\n",

We demonstrate that mice unable to metabolize fructose are protected from an increase in energy intake and body weight, visceral obesity, fatty liver, elevated insulin levels and hyperleptinaemia after exposure to 10% glucose for 14 weeks. In normal mice, glucose consumption is accompanied by aldose reductase and polyol pathway activation in steatotic areas. In this regard, we show that aldose reductase-deficient mice are protected against glucose-induced fatty liver.

Here, we show that the transcription factor Hobit is specifically up-regulated in Trm cells and, together with related Blimp1, mediates the development of Trm cells in skin, gut, liver, and kidney in mice. The Hobit-Blimp1 transcriptional module is also required for other populations of tissue-resident lymphocytes, including natural killer T (NKT) cells and liver-resident NK cells, all of which share a common transcriptional program. Our results identify Hobit and Blimp1 as central regulators of this universal program that instructs tissue retention in diverse tissue-resident lymphocyte populations.',\n",

The receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4, also functions as a coreceptor for T-tropic HIV-1 entry. We find that mice deficient for CXCR4 die perinatally and display profound defects in the hematopoietic and nervous systems. CXCR4-deficient mice have severely reduced B-lymphopoiesis, reduced myelopoiesis in fetal liver, and a virtual absence of myelopoiesis in bone marrow. However, T-lymphopoiesis is unaffected. Furthermore, the cerebellum develops abnormally with an irregular external granule cell layer, ectopically located Purkinje cells, and numerous chromophilic cell clumps of abnormally migrated granule cells within the cerebellar anlage. Identical defects are observed in mice lacking SDF-1, suggesting a monogamous relationship between CXCR4 and SDF-1. This receptor-ligand selectivity is unusual among chemokines and their receptors, as is the function in migration of nonhematopoietic cells.',\n",

We investigated whether Kupffer cell-dependent TNF-Î± signaling contributes to this poor outcome. Partial 30% liver transplantation was performed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice (control group), and in three groups with down-regulation of the TNF-Î± pathway: (i) TNF receptor 1 knockout [TNFR-1(-/-)] mice, and mice pretreated with (ii) gadolinium chloride or (iii) pentoxifylline (PTX). Fifty-percent partial liver transplantation, a model associated with full recovery, and transplantation in IL-6 knockout [IL-6(-/-)] mice were performed in some experiments. Graft injury, regeneration, portal flow, liver microcirculation, leukocyte adhesion, and animal survival were assessed. Animal survival rates were 14% in the control group vs. 43% in the gadolinium chloride group, 57% for the TNFR-1(-/-) group, and 86% in the PTX group (P &lt; 0.001). Markers of liver injury were reduced in all treated groups when compared with controls. Each treated group disclosed better portal flow and sinusoid perfusion, decreased leukocyte adherence, particularly in the PTX group. Liver regeneration occurred only in the treated groups. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were dramatically up-regulated (50Ã) in the PTX group, and at lower levels in other experimental groups. The protective effect of PTX was lost in IL-6(-/-) mice and protection was restored by a single dose of r-IL-6. In conclusion, interruption of TNF-Î± signaling or depletion of Kupffer cells improves survival after 30% liver transplantation, reduces liver injury, and enhances regeneration. The superior effects of PTX are mediated by IL-6.',\n",

Adipose-specific Glut4 (also known as Slc2a4) knockout (adipose-Glut4<SUP>-/-</SUP>) mice show insulin resistance secondarily in muscle and liver. Here we show, using DNA arrays, that expression of retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) is elevated in adipose tissue of adipose-Glut4<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice. We show that serum RBP4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant mice and humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. RBP4 levels are normalized by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug. Transgenic overexpression of human RBP4 or injection of recombinant RBP4 in normal mice causes insulin resistance. Conversely, genetic deletion of Rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity. Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid that increases urinary excretion of RBP4, normalizes serum RBP4 levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Increasing serum RBP4 induces hepatic expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and impairs insulin signalling in muscle. Thus, RBP4 is an adipocyte-derived `signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Lowering RBP4 could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.\",\n",

The disease onset leads to elevated levels of free radicals rendering the oxidant-inducing mechanisms incapable of protecting cellular organelles from inflicted damage. Herein, Î²-galactosidase-mediated bio-enzymatic synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was pioneered and characterized. These obtained ZnO NPs were assessed for their antidiabetic activity against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. For this objective, 36 male albino mice were separated into 6 groups. The diabetes was induced in mice with STZ (120 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP> body weight), and further treated with three different doses of ZnO NPs (0.5 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, 1 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, and 2 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP>) for 28 days. The results unveiled protective effects in diabetic mice treated with ZnO NPs through restoration of changes in body weight and normal glucose levels. The effects of ZnO NPs on lipid peroxidation and carbonyl contents were protective in liver, kidney and pancreas of diseased groups. Levels of serum biomarkers such as cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-C indicated ZnO NPs treatment caused these levels to plummet towards control parameters. Normal liver function markers and urea levels in serum indicated successful treatment of diabetic mice with ZnO NPs. Histopathological studies revealed protective and non-toxic effects of ZnO NPs over vital tissues of kidney, liver, and pancreas. The results divulge efficacious pharmaceutical potential of ZnO NPs against formation of reactive oxygen species by scavenging free radicals enhancing the functioning of antioxidant fortifying enzymes generating sustenance over hyperglycemic conditions.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases. Chronic inflammation is a mainstay of liver fibrosis, a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, but the role of MIF in liver scarring has not yet been elucidated. Here we have uncovered an unexpected antifibrotic role for MIF. Mice genetically deleted in Mif (Mif<SUP>-/-</SUP>) showed strongly increased fibrosis in two models of chronic liver injury. Pronounced liver fibrosis in Mif<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice was associated with alterations in fibrosis-relevant genes, but not by a changed intrahepatic immune cell infiltration. Next, a direct impact of MIF on hepatic stellate cells (HSC) was assessed in vitro. Although MIF alone had only marginal effects on HSCs, it markedly inhibited PDGF-induced migration and proliferation of these cells. The inhibitory effects of MIF were mediated by CD74, which we detected as the most abundant known MIF receptor on HSCs. MIF promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a CD74-dependent manner and, in turn, inhibition of AMPK reversed the inhibition of PDGF-induced HSC activation by MIF. The pivotal role of CD74 in MIF-mediated antifibrotic properties was further supported by augmented liver scarring of Cd74<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice. Moreover, mice treated with recombinant MIF displayed a reduced fibrogenic response in vivo. In conclusion, we describe a previously unexplored antifibrotic function of MIF that is mediated by the CD74/AMPK signaling pathway in HSCs. The results imply MIF and CD74 as targets for treatment of liver diseases.',\n",

Using bone marrow cells marked with integrated foamy virus vectors that express green fluorescent protein, we identify common proviral junctions in hepatic nodules and haematopoietic cells.

Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl<SUB>4</SUB>, a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage. We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named \"hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment\" (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids. The results of this analysis clearly confirmed the model prediction. We believe our procedure is widely applicable in the systems biology of tissues.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'A major concern in therapy of acute liver failure is protection of hepatocytes to prevent apoptosis and maintain liver function. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful tool to silence gene expression in mammalian cells. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA in vivo we used different mouse models of acute liver failure. We directed 21-nt siRNAs against caspase 8, which is a key enzyme in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic application of caspase 8 siRNA results in inhibition of caspase 8 gene expression in the liver, thereby preventing Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis. Protection of hepatocytes by caspase 8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver damage induced by agonistic Fas (CD95) antibody (Jo2) or by adenovirus expressing Fas ligand (AdFasL). However, in a clinical situation the siRNAs most likely would be applied after the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore we injected caspase 8 siRNA at a time point during AdFasL- and adenovirus wild type (Adwt)-mediated liver failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase 8 siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure. In addition, it is of particular interest that caspase 8 siRNA treatment was successful not only in acute liver failure mediated by specific Fas agonistic agents (Jo2 and AdFasL) but also in acute liver failure mediated by Adwt, which is an animal model reflecting multiple molecular mechanisms involved in human acute viral hepatitis. Consequently, our data raise hope for future successful application of siRNA in patients with acute liver failure.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Recently, hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)Î³ has been implicated in hepatic lipid accumulation. We found that the C3H mouse strain does not express PPARÎ³ in the liver and, when subject to a high-fat diet, is resistant to hepatic steatosis, compared with C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Adenoviral PPARÎ³2 injection into B6 and C3H mice caused hepatic steatosis, and microarray analysis demonstrated that hepatic PPARÎ³2 expression is associated with genes involved in fatty acid transport and the triglyceride synthesis pathway. In particular, hepatic PPARÎ³2 expression significantly increased the expression of monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (MGAT1). Promoter analysis by luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PPARÎ³2 directly regulates the MGAT1 promoter activity. The MGAT1 overexpression in cultured hepatocytes enhanced triglyceride synthesis without an increase of PPARÎ³ expression. Importantly, knockdown of MGAT1 in the liver significantly reduced hepatic steatosis in 12-wk-old high-fat-fed mice as well as ob/ob mice, accompanied by weight loss and improved glucose tolerance. These results suggest that the MGAT1 pathway induced by hepatic PPARÎ³ is critically important in the development of hepatic steatosis during diet-induced obesity.',\n",

By using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, C----A transversions at the first base and A----T transversions or A----G transitions at the second base of c-Ha-ras codon 61 were detected in 20-60% of spontaneous or carcinogen-induced liver tumors of the C3H/He, CBA, CF1, and B6C3F1 mouse strains, which are highly susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis. No such mutations, however, could be found in any of the 31 liver tumors of the insensitive C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse strains or in any of the 35 liver tumors of the comparatively resistant Wistar rat. Further analyses of c-Ha-ras codon 12 mutations in liver tumors from the three insensitive rodent strains also failed to give any positive results. In early precancerous liver lesions, c-Ha-ras codon 61 mutations were found in 13-14% of lesions of the sensitive C3H/He and B6C3F1 mouse strains but not in any of the 34 lesions of the insensitive C57BL/6J mouse. Taken together, our results indicate a close correlation between the mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of the different rodent strains and their susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis, whereby the mutations appear to provide a selective growth advantage, leading to a clonal expansion of the mutated liver cell population, only in livers of sensitive but not of insensitive strains.',\n",

Recently high salt intake has also been found to both be associated and predict the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Here we show that high-salt diet activates the aldose reductase (polyol) pathway in the liver, resulting in endogenous fructose production that then induces leptin resistance and the development of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. Blocking fructose metabolism blocks the effects of high-salt diet. High salt intake also predicts diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Japanese adults. Thus, high-salt diet, an essential micronutrient with no intrinsic caloric value, may have a contributory role in driving obesity and diabetes.',\n",

Fructose intake also causes features of metabolic syndrome in laboratory animals and humans. The first enzyme in fructose metabolism is fructokinase, which exists as two isoforms, A and C. Here we show that fructose-induced metabolic syndrome is prevented in mice lacking both isoforms but is exacerbated in mice lacking fructokinase A. Fructokinase C is expressed primarily in liver, intestine, and kidney and has high affinity for fructose, resulting in rapid metabolism and marked ATP depletion. In contrast, fructokinase A is widely distributed, has low affinity for fructose, and has less dramatic effects on ATP levels. By reducing the amount of fructose for metabolism in the liver, fructokinase A protects against fructokinase C-mediated metabolic syndrome.

The human transmembrane c-fms-like tyrosine kinase Flt-1 has recently been identified as a VEGF receptor. Flt-1 kinase has seven immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains and a kinase insert sequence, features shared by two other human gene-encoded proteins, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and FLT-4. In this study we show that the mouse homologue of KDR, Flk-1, is a second functional VEGF receptor. Flk-1 binds VEGF with high affinity, undergoes autophosphorylation, and mediates VEGF-dependent Ca2+ efflux in Xenopus oocytes injected with Flk-1 mRNA. We also demonstrate by in situ hybridization that Flk-1 protein expression in the mouse embryo is restricted to the vascular endothelium and the umbilical cord stroma. VEGF and its receptors Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1 may play a role in vascular development and regulation of vascular permeability.',\n",

Furthermore, overexpression of SERCA2b in the liver of obese mice significantly reduces the lipogenic gene expression and the triglyceride content in the liver.

       "    'abstract': 'Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of iron metabolism in which enhanced iron absorption of dietary iron causes increased iron accumulation in the liver, heart, and pancreas. Most individuals with HH are homozygous for a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The function of HFE protein is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it acts in association with Î²<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin and transferrin receptor 1 to regulate iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum, the proposed mechanism by which body iron levels are sensed. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by comparing clearance of transferrin-bound iron in Hfe knockout (KO) mice with that observed in C57BL/6 control mice. The mice were fed either an iron-deficient, control, or iron-loaded diet for 6 weeks to alter body iron status. The mice then were injected i.v. with <SUP>59</SUP>Fe-transferrin, and blood samples were taken over 2 h to determine the plasma <SUP>59</SUP>Fe turnover. After 2 h, the mice were killed and the amount of radioactivity in the duodenum, liver, and kidney was measured. In both Hfe KO and C57BL/6 mice, plasma iron turnover and iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum, liver, and kidney correlated positively with plasma iron concentration. However, duodenal iron uptake from plasma transferrin was decreased in the Hfe KO mice compared with the control mice. Despite this difference in duodenal uptake, the Hfe KO mice showed no decrease in iron uptake by the liver and kidney or alteration in the plasma iron turnover when compared with C57BL/6 mice. These data support the hypothesis that HFE regulates duodenal uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma, and that this mechanism of sensing body iron status, as reflected in plasma iron levels, is impaired in HH.',\n",

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are believed to be the major source of collagen-producing myofibroblasts in cirrhotic livers. Portal fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived cells, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) might also contribute to the myofibroblast population in damaged livers. Fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1, also called S100A4) is considered a marker of fibroblasts in different organs undergoing tissue remodeling and is used to identify fibroblasts derived from EMT in several organs including the liver. The aim of this study was to characterize FSP1-positive cells in human and experimental liver disease. FSP1-positive cells were increased in human and mouse experimental liver injury including liver cancer. However, FSP1 was not expressed by HSC or type I collagen-producing fibroblasts. Likewise, FSP1-positive cells did not express classical myofibroblast markers, including Î±SMA and desmin, and were not myofibroblast precursors in injured livers as evaluated by genetic lineage tracing experiments. Surprisingly, FSP1-positive cells expressed F4/80 and other markers of the myeloid-monocytic lineage as evaluated by double immunofluorescence staining, cell fate tracking, flow cytometry, and transcriptional profiling. Similar results were obtained for bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages. FSP1-positive cells were characterized by increased expression of COX2, osteopontin, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines but reduced expression of MMP3 and TIMP3 compared with Kupffer cells/macrophages. These findings suggest that FSP1 is a marker of a specific subset of inflammatory macrophages in liver injury, fibrosis, and cancer.',\n",

The most serious manifestations are profound mental retardation, intractable behavior problems, and death in the second decade. To generate a model for studies of pathophysiology and of potential therapy, we disrupted exon 6 of Naglu, the homologous mouse gene. Naglu-/- mice were healthy and fertile while young and could survive for 8-12 mo. They were totally deficient in Î±-N-acetylglucosaminidase and had massive accumulation of heparan sulfate in liver and kidney as well as secondary changes in activity of several other lysosomal enzymes in liver and brain and elevation of gangliosides G<SUB>M2</SUB> and G<SUB>M3</SUB> in brain. Vacuolation was seen in many cells, including macrophages, epithelial cells, and neurons, and became more prominent with age. Although most vacuoles contained finely granular material characteristic of glycosaminoglycan accumulation, large pleiomorphic inclusions were seen in some neurons and pericytes in the brain. Abnormal hypoactive behavior was manifested by 4.5-mo-old Naglu-/- mice in an open field test; the hyperactivity that is characteristic of affected children was not observed even in younger mice. In a Pavlovian fear conditioning test, the 4.5-mo-old mutant mice showed normal response to context, indicating intact hippocampal-dependent learning, but reduced response to a conditioning tone, perhaps attributable to hearing impairment. The phenotype of the Î±-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient mice is sufficiently similar to that of patients with the Sanfilippo syndrome type B to make these mice a good model for study of pathophysiology and for development of therapy.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"The 5' flanking region of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene contains a tissue-specific promoter and three upstream regulatory elements that behave as classical enhancers. At least one of these enhancers is now shown to be required for the tissue-specific expression of the AFP gene when it is introduced into the mouse genome by microinjection of cloned DNA fragments into fertilized eggs. Each enhancer can direct expression in the appropriate tissues, the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac, the fetal liver, and the gastrointestinal tract, but each exerts different influence in these three tissues. These differences may explain the tissue-specific diversity in the levels of expression characteristic of the AFP gene. The postnatal repression of transcription of the AFP gene in both liver and gut, as well as the reinitiation of its transcription during liver regeneration, is mimicked by the introduced gene when it is linked to the enhancer domains together or singly. Thus, the DNA sequence elements responsible for directing the activation of AFP transcription, its repression, and reinduction are contained in a limited segment of DNA within or 5 ' to the gene (or both) and are operative in the absence of the closely linked albumin gene.\",\n",

Here we examine the role of two-pore channel (TPC) 2, an endolysosomal cation channel, in these processes. Embryonic mouse fibroblasts and hepatocytes lacking TPC2 display a profound impairment of LDL-cholesterol and EGF/EGF-receptor trafficking. Mechanistically, both defects can be attributed to a dysfunction of the endolysosomal degradation pathway most likely on the level of late endosome to lysosome fusion. Importantly, endolysosomal acidification or lysosomal enzyme function are normal in TPC2-deficient cells. TPC2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to hepatic cholesterol overload and liver damage consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver hepatitis. These findings indicate reduced metabolic reserve of hepatic cholesterol handling. Our results suggest that TPC2 plays a crucial role in trafficking in the endolysosomal degradation pathway and, thus, is potentially involved in the homoeostatic control of many macromolecules and cell metabolites.',\n",

When fed a high fat diet containing NAM, a precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)<SUP>+</SUP>, these NNMT-overexpressing mice exhibit fatty liver deterioration following increased expression of the genes mediating fatty acid uptake and decreased very low-density lipoprotein secretion. NNMT overactivation decreased the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> content in the liver and also decreased gene activity related to fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting NAD<SUP>+</SUP>-dependent deacetylase Sirt3 function. Moreover, the transgenic mice showed liver fibrosis, with the induction of inflammatory and fibrosis genes. Induced NNMT expression decreased the tissue methylation capacity, thereby reducing methylation of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene promoter, resulting in increased CTGF expression. These data indicate that NNMT links the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> and methionine metabolic pathways and promotes liver steatosis and fibrosis.

Enhanced lipogenesis is accompanied by an insulin-stimulated increase in the mRNA encoding SREBP-1c, a transcription factor that activates the entire lipogenic program. Here, we report a branch point in the insulin signaling pathway that may account for selective insulin resistance. Exposure of rat hepatocytes to insulin produced a 25-fold increase in SREBP-1c mRNA and a 95% decrease in PEPCK mRNA. Insulin-mediated changes in both mRNAs were blocked by inhibitors of PI3K and Akt, indicating that these kinases are required for both pathways. In contrast, subnanomolar concentrations of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTORC1 kinase, blocked insulin induction of SREBP-1c, but had no effect on insulin suppression of PEPCK. We observed a similar selective effect of rapamycin in livers of rats and mice that experienced an insulin surge in response to a fasting-refeeding protocol. A specific inhibitor of S6 kinase, a downstream target of mTORC1, did not block insulin induction of SREBP-1c, suggesting a downstream pathway distinct from S6 kinase. These results establish mTORC1 as an essential component in the insulin-regulated pathway for hepatic lipogenesis but not gluconeogenesis, and may help to resolve the paradox of selective insulin resistance in livers of diabetic rodents.',\n",

Monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular portion of the mouse Kit receptor were established. Five percent to 10% of total bone marrow cells expressed the Kit receptor, and half of them lack the expression of lineage markers. The Kit receptor was expressed on 70-80% of Thy-1.1lo Lin-Sca-1+ cells, which express Thy-1.1 antigen at a low level and constitute approximately 0.05% of adult bone marrow and fetal liver; by previous studies, these cells have been shown to be highly enriched for multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and are the only hematopoietic cell subset with this activity. Spleen colony formation and long-term multilineage reconstitution activities were contained in the Kit+ but not in the Kit- subpopulations of Thy-1lo Lin-Sca-1+ cells from adult bone marrow, suggesting that the Kit receptor is expressed on HSCs from the earliest stage-i.e., pluripotent HSCs. The role of steel factor in the development and self-renewal of HSCs was tested with Sl/Sl homozygote fetuses, which lack genes to encode functional steel factor. They were shown to have 30-40% of the number of HSCs on days 13-15 when compared with normal litermates. However, the absolute number of HSCs increased during fetal development in the Sl/Sl mice. The results suggest that the Kit receptor-steel factor interaction may not be essential for the initiation of hematopoiesis and the self-renewal of (at least) fetal HSCs.',\n",

Here we show that SRSF3HKO mice carrying a hepatocyte-specific deletion of Srsf3 (homologous to human SRSF3/SRp20) have a disrupted hepatic architecture and show pre- and postnatal growth retardation. SRSF3HKO mice exhibit impaired hepatocyte maturation with alterations in glucose and lipid homeostasis characterized by reduced glycogen storage, fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity and reduced cholesterol synthesis. We identify various splicing alterations in the SRSF3HKO liver that explain the in vivo phenotype. In particular, loss of SRSF3 causes aberrant splicing of Hnf1Î±, Ern1, Hmgcs1, Dhcr7 and Scap genes, which are critical regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism.

We have assessed the impact of liposome composition on their clearance from the circulation in normal and tumor-bearing mice and on their uptake by tumors and various normal tissues. By selective changes in lipid composition, while maintaining a mean particle diameter of approximately equal to 100 nm, we have achieved up to a 60-fold increase in the fraction of recovered dose present in blood 24 hr after i.v. injection. Concomitantly, there was a decrease by a factor of 4 of the recovered dose localizing in the liver and spleen, the major organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Parallel experiments in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated a 25-fold increase of the liposome concentration in the tumor when formulations with long and short blood residence time were compared. The most favorable results were obtained with liposomes containing a small molar fraction of a negatively charged glycolipid, such as monosialoganglioside or phosphatidylinositol, and a solid-phase neutral phospholipid as the bulk component. The bio-distribution of such formulations is of considerable therapeutic potential in cancer for increasing the concentration of cytotoxic agents in tumors while minimizing the likelihood of toxicity to the reticuloendothelial system.',\n",

Analysis of surface characteristics, growth requirements, and kinetics suggested that these cells represent early stages of the B-cell differentiation pathway. Here we describe a modification of the assay, which allowed us to determine the differentiative potential of these clonable pre-B cells. Using a nitrocellulose protein-transfer technique, we studied immunoglobulin light chain expression in colonies derived from fetal mouse liver B-cell precursors; in particular, we explored whether the B-cell precursors are already committed to the expression of a particular light chain gene at the initiation of culture. Our results show that fetal liver-derived B-cell progenitors generate colonies in vitro that secrete kappa and lambda light chains at a ratio similar to that found in colonies derived from adult splenic B cells. Further, we document the existence of colonies that are derived from single cells and that simultaneously secrete both types of light chains. This indicates that the progenitors of (kappa + lambda)-producing colonies are light chain-uncommitted at the initiation of culture. These cells are able to rearrange their light chain genes in vitro and differentiate along the B-cell pathway to form colonies secreting both kappa and lambda chains.',\n",

It was found that in the presence of a wheat germ extract factor there was a high-affinity phase of the uptake into mouse liver mitochondria at 10-300 pM apocytochrome c, and a lower-affinity phase through 4000 pM. Without the factor, the high-affinity phase was absent. The stimulatory effect of the factor could not be elicited with various reductants, such as NADH, FMN, and ferrous protoheme IX. Conversely, when mitochondria loaded with apocytochrome c were resuspended in fresh medium, the protein readily reequilibrated. Successive washings depleted greater than 95% of the associated apoprotein but removed no holoprotein. Proteases (proteinase K or trypsin) added to a suspension of mitochondria loaded with apoprotein digested an amount of apoprotein similar to that which would have been dissociated during the same time, as measured by successive washings in the absence of protease. Mitochondria loaded with apoprotein and similarly treated with protease continued exporting the apoprotein, even after the protease was inhibited and removed, suggesting that most of the apoprotein associated with the organelle was in a protease-resistant compartment. Apocytochrome c mutants in which serines or alanines replaced cysteines 14 and 17, which bind the prosthetic group, behaved like the cysteine-containing protein, indicating that the covalent attachment of the heme is unrelated to the translocation of the apoprotein.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'In mammals, the central circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and it orchestrates peripheral clocks in the whole body to organize physiological and behavioral rhythms. Light-induced phase-shift of the SCN clock enables synchronization of the circadian clock system with 24-h environmental light/dark cycle. We previously found that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (Adar2), an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme catalyzing rhythmic A-to-I RNA editing, governs a wide range of mRNA rhythms in the mouse liver and regulates the circadian behavior. In brain, ADAR2-mediated A-to-I RNA editing was reported to occur in various transcripts encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, which could influence neuronal function of the SCN. Here we show that ADAR2 plays a crucial role for light-induced phase-shift of the circadian clock. Intriguingly, exposure of Adar2-knockout mice to a light pulse at late night caused an aberrant phase-advance of the locomotor rhythms. By monitoring the bioluminescence rhythms of the mutant SCN slices, we found that a phase-advance induced by treatment with pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was markedly attenuated. The present study suggests that A-to-I RNA editing in the SCN regulates a proper phase response to light in the mouse circadian system.',\n",

Here we reveal a molecular cascade consisting of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2, nuclear receptor Shp, and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 to maintain BA homeostasis. Bcl2 was overexpressed in liver of C57BL/6J mice using adenovirus mediated gene delivery for two weeks. Hepatic overexpression of Bcl2 caused drastic accumulation of serum BA and bilirubin levels and dysregulated BA synthetic enzymes and transporters. Bcl2 reactivation triggered severe liver injury, fibrosis and inflammation, which were accompanied by a significant induction of H19. Bcl2 induced rapid SHP protein degradation via the activation of caspase-8 pathway. The induction of H19 in Bcl2 overexpressed mice was contributed by a direct loss of Shp transcriptional repression. H19 knockdown or Shp re-expression largely rescued Bcl2-induced liver injury. Strikingly different than Shp, the expression of Bcl2 and H19 was hardly detectable in adult liver but was markedly increased in fibrotic/cirrhotic human and mouse liver. We demonstrated for the first time a detrimental effect of Bcl2 and H19 associated with cholestatic liver fibrosis and an indispensable role of Shp to maintain normal liver function.',\n",

Expression of genes related to steroid metabolism, such as 17Î²âhydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseâ7 (HSD17Î²7) and Cyp2a4, were increased approximately twoâfold, together with increases in estrogen receptorâÎ± (ERâÎ±) and ERâÎ±âlinked genes, such as anterior gradientâ2, keratin 1â19, and trefoil factorâ3. Arsenic in vitro induced a threeâfold increase in the expression of Î±âfetoprotein (AFP), a biomarker associated with transplacental arsenicâinduced mouse liver tumors. Thus, exposure of mouse fetal liver cells to arsenic induces adaptive responses and aberrant gene expression, which could alter genetic programming at a very early life stage, potentially contributing to tumor formation much later in life.',\n",

We have developed a mouse model that mimics these features of CGL: the syndrome occurs in transgenic mice expressing a truncated version of a nuclear protein known as nSREBP-1c (for sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c) under the control of the adipose-specific aP2 enhancer. Adipose tissue from these mice was markedly deficient in messenger RNAs encoding several fat-specific proteins, including leptin, a fat-derived hormone that regulates food intake and energy metabolism. Here we show that insulin resistance in our lipodystrophic mice can be overcome by a continuous systemic infusion of low doses of recombinant leptin, an effect that is not mimicked by chronic food restriction. Our results support the idea that leptin modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal independently of its effect on food intake, and that leptin deficiency accounts for the insulin resistance found in CGL.',\n",

To reduce soil As risk to humans by oral exposure, nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has been extensively studied for immobilizing As-contaminated soil, but its efficiency has not been investigated using in vitro assay and its influence on As-RBA. In this study, two contaminated soil samples (A and B) were amended with 1% and 2% (w/w) nZVI for 56 days to study its effect on As fraction by sequence extraction, As bioaccessibility by SBRC assay, and As relative bioavailability (RBA) by the mouse liver and kidney model. Based on the sequence extraction, the As associated with the E1 (exchangeable fraction) and C2 (carbonate fraction) fractions were decreased from 3.00% to 1.68% for soil A and from 21.6% to 7.86% for soil B after being treated with 2% nZVI for 56 days. When assessing As bioaccessibility in all soils treated with nZVI by SBRC assay, it was found that As bioaccessibility was significantly higher in the gastric phase (GP) and lower in the intestinal phase (IP) (p &lt; 0.05), and the bioaccessible Fe concentration decreased significantly from the gastric to intestinal phase at the same time. Based on the mouse liver-kidney model, the As-RBA in soil A increased from 21.6% to 22.3% and 39.9%, but in soil B decreased from 73.0% to 55.3% and 68.9%, respectively. In addition, there was a significant difference between As bioaccessibility based on GP or IP of SBRC assay and As-RBA in two soils after being treated with nZVI for 56 days. To more accurately assess the effects of nZVI human arsenic exposure, As-RBA should be considered in concert with secondary evidence provided through fraction and bioaccessibility assessments. In addition, it is necessary to develop a suitable in vitro assay to predict As-RBA in nZVI-amended soils.',\n",

Therefore, we investigated whether oral administration of sulforaphane (SFN) prevented high-fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice by regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver. Daily oral administrations of SFN reduced hepatic steatosis scores, serum ALT and AST levels, and hepatic levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids in mice fed a high-fat diet. These were correlated with the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the liver by SFN as evidenced by decrease in mRNA levels of ASC and caspase-1, caspase-1 enzyme activity, and IL-1Î² levels. SFN inhibited saturated fatty acid-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary mouse hepatocytes, accompanied by the restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction. The suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome by SFN was mediated by the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase-autophagy axis. Our findings demonstrated that the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by an orally available small molecule inhibitor leads to the alleviation of the hepatic steatosis symptoms associated with NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet.',\n",

Caloric restriction (CR) is commonly recommended for improvement of obesity-related diseases such as NAFLD. However, the effects of CR on hepatic metabolism remain unknown.

Moreover, western blot analysis showed that lipogenesis pathway enzymes in the liver of db/db mice were reduced by CR. In addition, CR reversed ketogenesis pathway enzymes and the enhanced autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, collagen deposition and endoplasmic reticulum stress in db/db mice. In particular, hepatic inflammation-related proteins including lipocalin-2 in db/db mice were attenuated by CR. Hepatic metabolomic studies yielded multiple pathological mechanisms of NAFLD.

This technology holds great promise for human gene therapy as a nonviral technology to deliver therapeutic genes. SB also provides a means to study the effects of defined genetic elements, such as oncogenes, on somatic cells in mice. Here, we test the ability of the SB transposon system to facilitate somatic integration of a transposon containing an activated NRAS oncogene in mouse hepatocytes to elicit tumor formation. NRAS oncogene-driven tumors developed when such vectors were delivered to the livers of p19Arf-null or heterozygous mice. Delivery of the NRAS transposon cooperates with Arf loss to cause carcinomas of hepatocellular or biliary origin. These tumors allowed characterization of transposon integration and expression at the single-cell level, revealing robust NRAS expression and both transposase-mediated and random insertion of delivered vectors. Random integration and expression of the SB transposase plasmid was also observed in one instance. In addition, studies using effector loop mutants of activated NRAS provide evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation alone cannot efficiently induce liver carcinomas.

After injection with NaAsO<SUB>2</SUB>, AQP9-null mice suffer reduced survival rates (LD<SUB>50</SUB>, 12 mg/kg) compared with WT mice (LD<SUB>50</SUB>, 15 mg/kg). The highest tissue level of arsenic is in heart, with AQP9-null mice accumulating 10-20 times more arsenic than WT mice. Within hours after NaAsO<SUB>2</SUB> injection, AQP9-null mice sustain profound bradycardia, despite normal serum electrolytes. Increased arsenic levels are also present in liver, lung, spleen, and testis of AQP9-null mice. Arsenic levels in the feces and urine of AQP9-null mice are only â10% of the WT levels, and reduced clearance of multiple arsenic species by the AQP9-null mice suggests that AQP9 is involved in the export of multiple forms of arsenic. Immunohistochemical staining of liver sections revealed that AQP9 is most abundant in basolateral membrane of hepatocytes adjacent to the sinusoids. AQP9 is not detected in heart or kidney by PCR or immunohistochemistry. We propose that AQP9 provides a route for excretion of arsenic by the liver, thereby providing partial protection of the whole animal from arsenic toxicity.',\n",

In definitive erythropoiesis, nuclei are expelled from erythroid precursor cells and are engulfed by macrophages. Phosphatidylserine is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and on the nuclei expelled from erythroid precursor cells; it works as an `eat me' signal for phagocytes. Phosphatidylserine is also expressed on the surface of exosomes involved in intercellular signalling. Here we established a library of hamster monoclonal antibodies against mouse peritoneal macrophages, and found an antibody that strongly inhibited the phosphatidylserine-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. The antigen recognized by the antibody was identified by expression cloning as a type I transmembrane protein called Tim4 (T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule; also known as Timd4). Tim4 was expressed in Mac1<SUP>+</SUP> cells in various mouse tissues, including spleen, lymph nodes and fetal liver. Tim4 bound apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine via its immunoglobulin domain. The expression of Tim4 in fibroblasts enhanced their ability to engulf apoptotic cells. When the anti-Tim4 monoclonal antibody was administered into mice, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by thymic macrophages was significantly blocked, and the mice developed autoantibodies. Among the other Tim family members, Tim1, but neither Tim2 nor Tim3, specifically bound phosphatidylserine. Tim1- or Tim4-expressing Ba/F3 B cells were bound by exosomes via phosphatidylserine, and exosomes stimulated the interaction between Tim1 and Tim4. These results indicate that Tim4 and Tim1 are phosphatidylserine receptors for the engulfment of apoptotic cells, and may also be involved in intercellular signalling in which exosomes are involved.\",\n",

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) is a regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis. To study the role of the expression of PEPCK gene in the development of NIDDM, we have produced lines of transgenic mice expressing a PEPCK minigene under control of its own promoter. Transgenic mice were hyperglycemic and had higher serum insulin concentrations. In addition, alterations in liver glycogen content and muscle glucose transporter GLUT-4 gene expression were detected. The overexpression of the PEPCK gene led to an increase in glucose production from pyruvate in hepatocytes in primary culture. When intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed, blood glucose levels were higher than those detected in normal mice. This animal model shows that primary alterations in the rate of liver glucose production may induce insulin resistance and NIDDM.',\n",

Unlike lipid or lipid-like nanoparticles, this formulation does not significantly reduce gene expression in hepatocytes or immune cells even at the dosage necessary for endothelial gene silencing.

Here, we establish an efficient, safe, non-integrative method to transiently express hepatocyte-growth-factor (HGF) and epidermal-growth-factor (EGF) in hepatocytes via nucleoside-modified, lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) delivery in mice. We confirm specific hepatotropism of mRNA-LNP via intravenous injection of firefly luciferase encoding mRNA-LNP, with protein expression lasting about 3 days. In the liver, virtually all hepatocytes are transfected along with a subpopulation of endothelial and Kupffer cells. In homeostasis, HGF mRNA-LNP efficiently induce hepatocyte proliferation. In a chronic liver injury mouse model recapitulating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, injections of both HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP sharply reverse steatosis and accelerate restoration of liver function. Likewise, HGF and EGF mRNA-LNP accelerate liver regeneration after acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury with rapid return to baseline ALT levels. This study introduces mRNA-LNP as a potentially translatable safe therapeutic intervention to harness liver regeneration via controlled expression of endogenous mitogens in vivo.',\n",

Neither B cells nor perforin were required to clear the viral DNA transcriptional template from the liver. In contrast, the template persisted for at least 60 days at high levels in NOD/Scid mice and at lower levels in the absence of CD4<SUP>+</SUP> and CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells, NK cells, Fas, IFN-gamma (IFN-Î³), IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-Î±/Î²R1), and TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), indicating that each of these effectors was required to eliminate the transcriptional template from the liver. Interestingly, viral replication was ultimately terminated in all lineages except the NOD/Scid mice, suggesting the existence of redundant pathways that inhibit HBV replication. Finally, induction of a CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cell response in these animals depended on the presence of CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells. These results are consistent with a model in which CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells serve as master regulators of the adaptive immune response to HBV; CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells are the key cellular effectors mediating HBV clearance from the liver, apparently by a Fas-dependent, perforin-independent process in which NK cells, IFN-Î³, TNFR1, and IFN-Î±/Î²R play supporting roles. These results provide insight into the complexity of the systems involved in HBV clearance, and they suggest unique directions for analysis of the mechanism(s) responsible for HBV persistence.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for chronic liver failure, although it is complicated by donor shortage, surgery-related complications, and immunological rejection. Cell transplantation is an alternative, minimally invasive treatment option with potentially fewer complications. We used human palatine tonsil as a novel source of mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) and examined their ability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells in vivo and in vitro. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl<SUB>4</SUB>) mouse model was used to investigate the ability of T-MSCs to home to the site of liver injury. T-MSCs were only detected in the damaged liver, suggesting that they are disease-responsive. Differentiation of T-MSCs into hepatocyte-like cells was confirmed in vitro as determined by expression of hepatocyte markers. Next, we showed resolution of liver fibrosis by T-MSCs via reduction of TGF-Î² expression and collagen deposition in the liver. We hypothesized that autophagy activation was a possible mechanism for T-MSC-mediated liver recovery. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that T-MSCs can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells and ameliorate liver fibrosis via autophagy activation and down-regulation of TGF-Î². These findings suggest that T-MSCs could be used as a novel source for stem cell therapy targeting liver diseases.',\n",

In vitro, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and interleukin-11 display overlapping activities with IL-6. This functional redundancy may be explained by the interactions of specific binding receptors with a common signal-transducing receptor (gp130) (for reviews see refs 3, 4). To elucidate the unique function of IL-6 in vivo, we have disrupted the IL-6 gene by homologous recombination. IL-6-deficient mice develop normally. They fail to control efficiently vaccinia virus and infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular bacterium. The T-cell-dependent antibody response against vesicular stomatitis virus is impaired. Further, the inflammatory acute-phase response after tissue damage or infection is severely compromised, whereas it is only moderately affected after challenge with lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that IL-6 production induced by injury or infection is an important in vivo SOS signal which coordinates activities of liver cells, macrophages and lymphocytes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive cognitive impairment. The initiation and progression of AD has been linked to cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, processes that can be modulated by liver x receptors (LXRs). We show here that endogenous LXR signaling impacts the development of AD-related pathology. Genetic loss of either LxrÎ± or LxrÎ² in APP/PS1 transgenic mice results in increased amyloid plaque load. LXRs regulate basal and inducible expression of key cholesterol homeostatic genes in the brain and act as potent inhibitors of inflammatory gene expression. Ligand activation of LXRs attenuates the inflammatory response of primary mixed glial cultures to fibrillar amyloid Î² peptide (fAÎ²) in a receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, LXRs promote the capacity of microglia to maintain fAÎ²-stimulated phagocytosis in the setting of inflammation. These results identify endogenous LXR signaling as an important determinant of AD pathogenesis in mice. We propose that LXRs may be tractable targets for the treatment of AD due to their ability to modulate both lipid metabolic and inflammatory gene expression in the brain.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease and the leading genetic cause of infant mortality; it results from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped, but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient. Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection. Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate.',\n",

There are no anti-fibrotic drugs with efficacy against liver cirrhosis. Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of tissue fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a Î²-catenin/CBP (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) inhibitor on liver fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic activity of PRI-724, a selective inhibitor of Î²-catenin/CBP, was assessed in HCV GT1b transgenic mice at 18 months after HCV genome expression. PRI-724 was injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously in these mice for 6 weeks. PRI-724 reduced liver fibrosis, which was indicated by silver stain, Sirius Red staining, and hepatic hydroxyproline levels, in HCV mice while attenuating Î±SMA induction. PRI-724 led to increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 mRNA in the liver, along with elevated levels of intrahepatic neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes. The induced intrahepatic neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes were identified as the source of MMP-8. In conclusion, PRI-724 ameliorated HCV-induced liver fibrosis in mice. We hypothesize that inhibition of hepatic stellate cells activation and induction of fibrolytic cells expressing MMP-8 contribute to the anti-fibrotic effects of PRI-724. PRI-724 is a drug candidate which possesses anti-fibrotic effect.',\n",

In rat liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain, more rapid rates of catabolism were found for acidic protein fractions than for neutral or basic ones. Acidic proteins also tended to be degraded faster in several mouse tissues. A literature survey confirmed this trend. For 22 proteins from rat liver, a highly significant correlation was found between rates of degradation and isoelectric points (r = 0.824; P less than 0.01).

SRS spectral microscopy has been used to obtain two-dimensional spectral images of rat liver tissue, three-dimensional images of a vessel in rat liver, and in vivo spectral images of mouse ear skin. Various multivariate analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, have been used to obtain spectral images. In this study, we propose a digital staining method. This method uses SRS spectra and statistical machine learning that makes use of prior knowledge of spectral peaks and their two-dimensional distributional patterns corresponding to the composition of tissue samples. The method selects spectral peaks on the basis of Mahalanobis distance, which is defined as the ratio of inter-group variation to intragroup variation. We also make use of higher-order local autocorrelations as feature values for two-dimensional distributional patterns. This combination of techniques allows groups corresponding to different intracellular structures to be clearly discriminated in the multidimensional feature space. We investigate the performance of our method on mouse liver tissue samples and show that the proposed method can digitally stain each intracellular structure such as cell nuclei, cytoplasm, and erythrocytes separately and clearly without time-consuming chemical staining processes.

The GNMT-MT plasmid containing a miR-224 binding site silent mutation of the GNMT coding sequence can escape the suppression of miR-224 in HEK293T cells. Expression of both exogenous and endogenous GNMT was suppressed by miR-224, while miR-224 inhibitor enhanced GNMT expression. miR-224 counteracts the effects of GNMT on the reduction of cell proliferation and tumor growth. The levels of miR-224 and GNMT mRNA showed a significant inverse relationship in tumor specimens from HCC patients. Utilizing CCl4-treated hepatoma cells and mice as a cell damage of inflammatory or liver injury model, we observed that the decreased expression levels of GNMT were accompanied with the elevated expression levels of miR-224 in hepatoma cells and mouse liver. Finally, hepatic AAV-mediated GNMT also reduced CCl4-induced miR-224 expression and liver fibrosis.

       "    'abstract': 'Theranostics is an innovative research field that aims to develop high target specificity cancer treatments by administering small metal-based nanoparticles (NPs). This new generation of compounds exhibits diagnostic and therapeutic properties due to the high atomic number of their metal component. In the framework of a combined research program on low dose X-ray imaging and theranostic NPs, X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) was performed at ESRF using a 3 Î¼m pixel optical system on two samples: a mouse brain bearing melanoma metastases injected with gadolinium NPs and, a mouse liver injected with gold NPs. XPCT is a non-destructive technique suitable to achieve the 3D reconstruction of a specimen and, widely used at micro-scale to detect abnormalities of the vessels, which are associated to the tumor growth or to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, XPCT represents a promising and complementary tool to study the biodistribution of theranostic NPs in biological materials, thanks to the strong contrast with respect to soft tissues that metal-based NPs provide in radiological images. This work is relied on an original imaging approach based on the evaluation of the contrast differences between the images acquired below and above K-edge energies, as a proof of the certain localization of NPs. We will present different methods aiming to enhance the localization of NPs and a 3D map of their distribution in large volume of tissues.',\n",

To this end, we piloted the Chinese population studies to address whether hepcidin is linked to liver functionality. The serum hepcidin, ferritin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and bilirubin were examined in two independent Chinese cohorts consisted of 3455 individuals. After adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking habits, drinking categories and diabetic status, a positive association between hepcidin and alanine transaminase (ALT) (beta\\u2009=\\u20090.18\\u2009Â±\\u20090.01, P\\u2009&lt;\\u20090.0001) was discovered using linear regression in a cohort consisting of 1813 individuals.

Furthermore, consistent with cohort study, by applying both CCl<SUB>4</SUB> and lipopolysaccharide induced mouse liver injury models, at least 2-fold elevations in hepcidin expression, serum ALT and inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were discovered during the initiation stage of liver injury. Our findings suggest that increased serum hepcidin may reflect a protective response to the iron status and elevated serum cytokines during liver injury. Additional studies are warranted to validate these findings and test their potential clinical relevance in patients.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Hepatic fibrosis is associated with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). In this study, we aimed to determine what role MSCs play in the process and how they mobilize from bone marrow (BM). We employed a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride(CCl<SUB>4</SUB>)-induced liver fibrosis. Frozen section was used to detect MSCs recruited to mice and human fibrotic liver. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was detected to assess liver function. It was found that MSCs of both exogenous and endogenous origin could aggravate liver fibrosis and attenuate liver damage as indicated by lower serum ALT and AST levels. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1Î±)/ CXCR4 was the most important chemotactic axis regulating MSCs migration from BM to fibrotic liver. Frozen section results showed that the migration did not start from the beginning of liver injury but occured when the expression balance of SDF-1Î± between liver and BM was disrupted, where SDF-1Î± expression in liver was higher than that in BM. Our findings provide further evidence to show the role of BM-MSCs in liver fibrosis and to elucidate the mechanism underlying MSCs mobilization in our early liver fibrosis mice model induced by CCl<SUB>4</SUB>.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in worldwide prevalence, closely tracking the obesity epidemic, but specific pharmaceutical treatments for NAFLD are lacking. Defining the key molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD is essential for developing new drugs. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of gut-derived serotonin synthesis ameliorates hepatic steatosis through a reduction in liver serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) signaling. Local serotonin concentrations in the portal blood, which can directly travel to and affect the liver, are selectively increased by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice. Both gut-specific Tph1 knockout mice and liver-specific Htr2a knockout mice are resistant to HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, without affecting systemic energy homeostasis. Moreover, selective HTR2A antagonist treatment prevents HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Thus, the gut TPH1-liver HTR2A axis shows promise as a drug target to ameliorate NAFLD with minimal systemic metabolic effects.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a powerful technology that relies on Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) to target and edit DNA. However, many therapeutic targets cannot currently be accessed due to the lack of carriers that can deliver RNPs systemically. Here, we report a generalizable methodology that allows engineering of modified lipid nanoparticles to efficiently deliver RNPs into cells and edit tissues including muscle, brain, liver, and lungs. Intravenous injection facilitated tissue-specific, multiplexed editing of six genes in mouse lungs. High carrier potency was leveraged to create organ-specific cancer models in livers and lungs of mice though facile knockout of multiple genes. The developed carriers were also able to deliver RNPs to restore dystrophin expression in DMD mice and significantly decrease serum PCSK9 level in C57BL/6 mice. Application of this generalizable strategy will facilitate broad nanoparticle development for a variety of disease targets amenable to protein delivery and precise gene correction approaches.',\n",

       "    'abstract': \"Previous experiments have demonstrated that the human beta-globin gene is correctly regulated in transgenic mice. The beta-globin gene is not expressed in yolk sac-derived erythroid cells in early embryonic development but is expressed concomitantly with the adult mouse beta-globin genes in 14- to 16-day fetal liver and adult reticulocytes. In an attempt to localize sequences that direct erythroid-specific expression, fragments of the human beta-globin gene were inserted in the opposite orientation 200 base pairs (bp) upstream of an intact human A gamma marker gene, which is not expressed on its own in mouse fetal liver. In the experiments reported here, two beta-globin 3' sequences activated the marker gene specifically in fetal liver. One sequence is located in a 250-bp Pst I fragment 550-800 bp downstream from the poly(A) site; the other is located near an EcoRI site in the third exon. These two sequences are active individually, and their combined effect is greater than their effects alone. beta-Globin 5' sequences from -815 to -50 were also analyzed for activity in this assay. The 5' sequences did not activate the marker gene when tested alone but did stimulate expression that was already directed to adult erythroid tissue by the two 3' sequences. These results suggest that three separate sequences are involved in human beta-globin gene regulation. The two 3' sequences act as adult erythroid enhancers and the 5' sequence stimulates expression that is already determined to be erythroid specific.\",\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway plays a pivotal role in liver structural and metabolic homeostasis. Wnt activity is tightly regulated by the acyltransferase Porcupine through the addition of palmitoleate. Interestingly palmitoleate can be endogenously produced by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a lipogenic enzyme transcriptionally regulated by insulin. This study aimed to determine whether nutritional conditions, and insulin, regulate Wnt pathway activity in liver. An adenoviral TRE-Luciferase reporter was used as a readout of Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activity, in vivo in mouse liver and in vitro in primary hepatocytes. Refeeding enhanced TRE-Luciferase activity and expression of Wnt target genes in mice liver, revealing a nutritional regulation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. This effect was inhibited in liver specific insulin receptor KO (iLIRKO) mice and upon wortmannin or rapamycin treatment. Overexpression or inhibition of SCD1 expression regulated Wnt/Î²-catenin activity in primary hepatocytes. Similarly, palmitoleate added exogenously or produced by SCD1-mediated desaturation of palmitate, induced Wnt signaling activity. Interestingly, this effect was abolished in the absence of Porcupine, suggesting that both SCD1 and Porcupine are key mediators of insulin-induced Wnt/Î²-catenin activity in hepatocytes. Altogether, our findings suggest that insulin and lipogenesis act as potential novel physiological inducers of hepatic Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.',\n",

These challenges, coupled with exogenous exposure to agents that generate reactive oxygen species, are both associated with normal aging processes and linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, cataract formation, and fatty liver disease. Although not all of these diseases have been definitively shown to originate from mutations in nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA, repair of oxidized, saturated, and ring-fragmented bases via the base excision repair pathway is known to be critical for maintaining genomic stability. One enzyme that initiates base excision repair of ring-fragmented purines and some saturated pyrimidines is NEIL1, a mammalian homolog to Escherichia coli endonuclease VIII. To investigate the organismal consequences of a deficiency in NEIL1, a knockout mouse model was created. In the absence of exogenous oxidative stress, neil1 knockout (neil1<SUP>-/-</SUP>) and heterozygotic (neil1<SUP>+/-</SUP>) mice develop severe obesity, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease and also have a tendency to develop hyperinsulinemia. In humans, this combination of clinical manifestations, including hypertension, is known as the metabolic syndrome and is estimated to affect &gt;40 million people in the United States. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA from neil1<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice show increased levels of steady-state DNA damage and deletions relative to wild-type controls. These data suggest an important role for NEIL1 in the prevention of the diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Tfm (testicular feminization) mutant mice lack functional androgen receptors. By studying liver tumor development in Tfm mice, we have shown that the greater susceptibility of male mice relative to female mice for liver tumor induction by N,N-diethylnitrosamine is androgen receptor-dependent. C57BL/6J normal and Tfm mutant mice were injected at 12 days of age with N,N-diethylnitrosamine (0.2 mumol/g, i.p.), and liver tumors were enumerated in 50-week-old animals. Normal males averaged 20 liver tumors per animal; Tfm males, 0.7; normal females, 0.6; and Tfm/+ heterozygous females, 1.5. The androgen receptor gene and the Tfm mutation are X chromosome linked. Because of random X chromosome inactivation, hepatocytes from Tfm/+ heterozygous female mice are mosaic with respect to the expression of mutant or wild-type receptors. To determine if testosterone acts directly as a liver tumor promoter, through the androgen receptor in preneoplastic hepatocytes, or by an indirect mechanism, we chronically treated these mosaic female mice with testosterone and measured the androgen receptor content of the resulting tumors. B6C3F1 Tfm/+ mosaic and +/+ wild-type female mice were injected i.p. at 12 days of age with N,N-diethylnitrosamine (0.1 mumol/g) and ovariectomized at 8 weeks of age. Half of the mice of each group subsequently received biweekly s.c. injections of testosterone (0.15 mg per mouse) for 30 weeks. Tumor multiplicity was the same for wild-type and Tfm/+ mosaic females treated with testosterone (31-32 tumors per animal at 38 weeks of age) and was increased relative to females not treated with testosterone (13-17 tumors per animal at 50 weeks of age). Testosterone treatment did not significantly increase the percentage of androgen receptor-positive tumors in Tfm/+ mosaic females: 58% of the tumors from Tfm/+ mosaic females treated with testosterone were receptor positive compared to 48% in Tfm/+ females not treated with testosterone and 92% in wild-type females treated with testosterone. Finally, the number of androgen receptors in the majority of liver tumors examined was greatly decreased relative to the surrounding normal liver tissue. We conclude that liver tumor promotion by testosterone requires a functional androgen receptor in the intact animal. However, this promotion is not cell autonomous; that is, the response of the preneoplastic hepatocyte is not dependent on the expression of functional receptor in the target cell.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Carbohydrate response element (ChRE)-binding protein (ChREBP) is a recently discovered transcription factor that is activated in response to high glucose concentrations in liver independently of insulin. ChREBP was first identified by its ability to bind the ChRE of the liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) gene. We recently reported that the increase in expression of multiple liver lipogenic enzyme mRNAs elicited by feeding a high-carbohydrate diet as well as that of LPK mRNA is markedly reduced in mice lacking ChREBP gene expression (ChREBP<SUP>-/-</SUP>) in comparison to WT mice. The present study provides evidence for a direct and dominant role of ChREBP in the glucose regulation of two key liver lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC, FAS, and LPK mRNA levels were higher in WT hepatocytes cultured with high (25 mM) rather than low (5.5 mM) glucose medium, but there was no effect of glucose concentration on these mRNA levels in ChREBP<SUP>-/-</SUP> hepatocytes. Similarly, reporter constructs containing ACC, FAS, or LPK gene ChREs were responsive to glucose when transfected into WT but not ChREBP<SUP>-/-</SUP> hepatocytes, and glucose transactivation of the constructs in ChREBP<SUP>-/-</SUP> hepatocytes was restored by cotransfection with a ChREBP expression plasmid. ChREBP binding to ACC, FAS, and LPK ChRE sequences in vitro was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility super shift assays. In vivo binding of ChREBP to ACC, FAS, and LPK gene promoters in intact liver nuclei from rats fed a high-carbohydrate diet was demonstrated by using a formaldehyde crosslinking and chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Platensimycin (PTM) is a recently discovered broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by Streptomyces platensis. It acts by selectively inhibiting the elongation-condensing enzyme FabF of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in bacteria. We report here that PTM is also a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mammalian fatty acid synthase. In contrast to two agents, C75 and cerulenin, that are widely used as inhibitors of mammalian fatty acid synthase, platensimycin specifically inhibits fatty acid synthesis but not sterol synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes. PTM preferentially concentrates in liver when administered orally to mice and potently inhibits hepatic de novo lipogenesis, reduces fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose oxidation. Chronic administration of platensimycin led to a net reduction in liver triglyceride levels and improved insulin sensitivity in db/+ mice fed a high-fructose diet. PTM also reduced ambient glucose levels in db/db mice. These results provide pharmacological proof of concept of inhibiting fatty acid synthase for the treatment of diabetes and related metabolic disorders in animal models.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Fluorescent imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR II, 1-1.4 Î¼m) holds much promise due to minimal autofluorescence and tissue scattering. Here, using well-functionalized biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as NIR II fluorescent imaging agents, we performed high-frame-rate video imaging of mice during intravenous injection of SWNTs and investigated the path of SWNTs through the mouse anatomy. We observed in real-time SWNT circulation through the lungs and kidneys several seconds postinjection, and spleen and liver at slightly later time points. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging through principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and found to greatly increase the anatomical resolution of organs as a function of time postinjection. Importantly, PCA was able to discriminate organs such as the pancreas, which could not be resolved from real-time raw images. Tissue phantom studies were performed to compare imaging in the NIR II region to the traditional NIR I biological transparency window (700-900 nm). Examination of the feature sizes of a common NIR I dye (indocyanine green) showed a more rapid loss of feature contrast and integrity with increasing feature depth as compared to SWNTs in the NIR II region. The effects of increased scattering in the NIR I versus NIR II region were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation. In vivo fluorescence imaging in the NIR II region combined with PCA analysis may represent a powerful approach to high-resolution optical imaging through deep tissues, useful for a wide range of applications from biomedical research to disease diagnostics.',\n",

A 10 mm diameter perspex phantom containing a fat surrogate (sunflower oil) and aqueous solutions of ferric nitrate, calcium chloride, and iodine was imaged with multiple energy bins. The authors used the spectroscopic characteristics of the CT number to establish a basis for the decomposition of soft tissue components. The potential of the method of constrained least squares for quantifying different sets of materials was evaluated in terms of information entropy and degrees of freedom, with and without the use of a volume conservation constraint. The measurement performance was evaluated quantitatively using atheroma and mouse equivalent phantoms. Finally the decomposition method was assessed qualitatively using a euthanized mouse and an excised human atherosclerotic plaque.Results:Spectral CT measurements of a phantom containing tissue surrogates confirmed the ability to distinguish these materials by the spectroscopic characteristics of their CT number. The assessment of performance potential in terms of information entropy and degrees of freedom indicated that certain sets of up to three materials could be decomposed by the method of constrained least squares. However, there was insufficient information within the data set to distinguish calcium from iron within soft tissues. The quantification of calcium concentration and fat mass fraction within atheroma and mouse equivalent phantoms by spectral CT correlated well with the nominal values (R2 = 0.990 and R2 = 0.985, respectively). In the euthanized mouse and excised human atherosclerotic plaque, regions of calcium and fat were appropriately decomposed according to their spectroscopic characteristics.Conclusions:Spectral CT, using the Medipix3 detector and silicon sensor layer, can quantify certain sets of up to three materials using the proposed method of constrained least squares. The system has some ability to independently distinguish calcium, fat, and water, and these have been quantified within phantom equivalents of fatty liver and atheroma. In this configuration, spectral CT cannot distinguish iron from calcium within soft tissues.',\n",

When cell division is induced in mouse liver and kidney a very early event is a change in masking in chromatin. This precedes changes in RNA populations; both precede DNA synthesis.

Levels of adiponectin in plasma are reduced in obesity, which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thus, orally active small molecules that bind to and activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 could ameliorate obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Here we report the identification of orally active synthetic small-molecule AdipoR agonists. One of these compounds, AdipoR agonist (AdipoRon), bound to both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in vitro. AdipoRon showed very similar effects to adiponectin in muscle and liver, such as activation of AMPK and PPAR-Î± pathways, and ameliorated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet, which was completely obliterated in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 double-knockout mice. Moreover, AdipoRon ameliorated diabetes of genetically obese rodent model db/db mice, and prolonged the shortened lifespan of db/db mice on a high-fat diet. Thus, orally active AdipoR agonists such as AdipoRon are a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes.',\n",

We note that Sirt3<SUP>â/â</SUP> mouse embryonic fibroblasts have a reduction in basal ATP levels. Reconstitution with wild-type but not a deacetylase-deficient form of Sirt3 restored ATP levels in these cells. Furthermore in wild-type mice, the resting level of ATP correlates with organ-specific Sirt3 protein expression. Remarkably, in mice lacking Sirt3, basal levels of ATP in the heart, kidney, and liver were reduced &gt;50%. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial protein acetylation is markedly elevated in Sirt3<SUP>â/â</SUP> tissues. In addition, in the absence of Sirt3, multiple components of Complex I of the electron transport chain demonstrate increased acetylation. Sirt3 can also physically interact with at least one of the known subunits of Complex I, the 39-kDa protein NDUFA9. Functional studies demonstrate that mitochondria from Sirt3<SUP>â/â</SUP> animals display a selective inhibition of Complex I activity. Furthermore, incubation of exogenous Sirt3 with mitochondria can augment Complex I activity. These results implicate protein acetylation as an important regulator of Complex I activity and demonstrate that Sirt3 functions in vivo to regulate and maintain basal ATP levels.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The efficiency of first-generation adenoviral vectors as gene delivery tools is often limited by the short duration of transgene expression, which can be related to immune responses and to toxic effects of viral proteins. In addition, readministration is usually ineffective unless the animals are immunocompromised or a different adenovirus serotype is used. Recently, adenoviral vectors devoid of all viral coding sequences (helper-dependent or gutless vectors) have been developed to avoid expression of viral proteins. In mice, liver-directed gene transfer with AdSTK109, a helper-dependent adenoviral (Ad) vector containing the human Î±<SUB>1</SUB>-antitrypsin (hAAT) gene, resulted in sustained expression for longer than 10 months with negligible toxicity to the liver. In the present report, we have examined the duration of expression of AdSTK109 in the liver of baboons and compared it to first-generation vectors expressing hAAT. Transgene expression was limited to approximately 3-5 months with the first-generation vectors. In contrast, administration of AdSTK109 resulted in transgene expression for longer than a year in two of three baboons. We have also investigated the feasibility of circumventing the humoral response to the virus by sequential administration of vectors of different serotypes. We found that the ineffectiveness of readministration due to the humoral response to an Ad5 first-generation vector was overcome by use of an Ad2-based vector expressing hAAT. These data suggest that long-term expression of transgenes should be possible by combining the reduced immunogenicity and toxicity of helper-dependent vectors with sequential delivery of vectors of different serotypes.',\n",

HBx exhibits pleiotropic biological effects, whose in vivo relevance is a matter for debate. In the present report, we have used a combination of HBx-expressing transgenic mice and liver cell transplantation to investigate the in vivo impact of HBx expression on liver cell proliferation and viability in a regenerative context. We show that moderate HBx expression inhibits liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in HBx-expressing transgenic mice. We also demonstrate that the transplantation of HBx-expressing liver cells, isolated from HBx transgenic mice, is sufficient to inhibit overall recipient liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Moreover, the injection of serum samples drawn from HBx-expressing transgenic mice mimicked the inhibitory effect of HBx on liver regeneration. Finally, the incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with the supernatant of HBx-expressing liver cells inhibits cellular DNA synthesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate a paracrine inhibitory effect of HBx on liver cell proliferation and lead us to propose HBV as one of the few viruses implicated in human cancer which act, at least in part, through paracrine biological pathways.',\n",

Here we develop a xenograft mouse model using hepatocytes from a patient with familial hypercholesterolaemia caused by loss-of-function mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Like familial hypercholesterolaemia patients, our familial hypercholesterolaemia liver chimeric mice develop hypercholesterolaemia and a 'humanized` serum profile, including expression of the emerging drug targets cholesteryl ester transfer protein and apolipoprotein (a), for which no genes exist in mice. We go on to replace the missing LDLR in familial hypercholesterolaemia liver chimeric mice using an adeno-associated virus 9-based gene therapy and restore normal lipoprotein profiles after administration of a single dose. Our study marks the first time a human metabolic disease is induced in an experimental animal model by human hepatocyte transplantation and treated by gene therapy. Such xenograft platforms offer the ability to validate human experimental therapies and may foster their rapid translation into the clinic.\",\n",

Because reelin structurally resembles extracellular matrix proteins, and because many of these proteins are expressed in blood, we hypothesized that reelin also might be detectable in the circulation. Reelin (420 kDa) and two reelin-like immunoreactive bands (310 and 160 kDa) are expressed in serum and platelet-poor plasma of rats, mice, and humans, but these three bands were not detectable in serum of homozygous reeler (rl/rl) mice. Reelin plasma levels in heterozygous (rl/+) mice were half of those in wild-type littermates. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry using antireelin mAbs indicated that reelin-like immunoreactivity was expressed in a subset of chromaffin cells within the rat adrenal medulla and in a subset of cells coexpressing Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone within the pituitary pars intermedia. However, surgical removal of adrenal or pituitary failed to decrease the amount of reelin (420-kDa band) expressed in serum. Adult liver expressed one-third of the reelin mRNA concentration expressed in adult mouse cerebral cortex. Full-length reelin protein was detectable in liver extracts in situ; acutely isolated liver cells also secreted full-length reelin in vitro. Liver appears to be a prime candidate to produce and maintain the circulating reelin pool. It now becomes relevant to ask whether circulating reelin has a physiologic role on one or more peripheral target tissues.',\n",

Studying mouse models, we show that YAP and TAZ can also exert a tumor-suppressive function. We found that normal hepatocytes surrounding liver tumors displayed activation of YAP and TAZ and that deletion of Yap and Taz in these peritumoral hepatocytes accelerated tumor growth. Conversely, experimental hyperactivation of YAP in peritumoral hepatocytes triggered regression of primary liver tumors and melanoma-derived liver metastases. Furthermore, whereas tumor cells growing in wild-type livers required YAP and TAZ for their survival, those surrounded by Yap- and Taz-deficient hepatocytes were not dependent on YAP and TAZ. Tumor cell survival thus depends on the relative activity of YAP and TAZ in tumor cells and their surrounding tissue, suggesting that YAP and TAZ act through a mechanism of cell competition to eliminate tumor cells.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Using the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell thymidine kinase locus and the Salmonella his locus assays, the mutagenic potentials of several catecholamines and related compounds were examined. No supplementary metabolic activation systems were used. In the mouse lymphoma assay, the dihydroxybenzenes catechol and hydroquinone had similar and appreciable mutagenic potentials, whereas resorcinol was less active. Derivatives of catechol, such as dopamine and epinephrine, were mutagenic, whereas the related monohydroxylated compounds tyramine and synephrine were inactive. The primary amine, arterenol, and the corresponding secondary amine, epinephrine, induced similar mutagenic responses. Carboxylation of the side chain of dopamine, giving Lâdopa, reduced the maximum mutagenic response. The introduction of charged groups directly on to the aromatic ring also reduced mutagenic activity, while an intervening methylene reversed this effect. Thus, 3,4âdihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid was more active than 3,4âdihydroxybenzoic acid. The compound active at the lowest doses was 4âtertâbutyl catechol. The activities of these compounds are highly dependent upon substituent groups. Experiments with superoxide dismutase gave circumstantial evidence for some of the mutagenic activity being due to superoxide anion. Active oxygen species might be responsible for some of the observed effects, but this cannot be concluded from the superoxide dismutase experiments. Mutagenic responses in Salmonella were very low but were significant for Lâdopa in three strains and for epinephrine and arterenol in one strain. Limited DNA association studies of 14Câdopamine suggest interactions in L5178Y and Salmonella cells and in mouse liver. The mutagenicity of dopamine in L5178Y is reduced by high serum concentrations during the exposure period, while the apparent association with DNA is unaffected.',\n",

In the present study, apoptosis-inhibiting effects of diallyl sulfide against a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA), in Swiss albino mice were observed. The animals were given either 250 Î¼g/mouse or 500 Î¼g/mouse of diallyl sulfide for 1 week after a single intragastric dose of 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (50 mg/kg body weight). Results showed that diallyl sulfide supplementation effectively protects against 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthraceneâinduced oxidative stress, characterized by restored antioxidant enzyme levels (up to 64%) and lipid peroxidation (up to 25%). Flow cytometric analysis showed a reduction in apoptotic cell population in hypodiploid region in diallyl sulfideâsupplemented animals. Inhibition of apoptosis was preceded by decrease in reactive oxygen species levels and restoration of mitochondrial transmembrane potential followed by decreased DNA fragmentation. In 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthraceneâexposed animals, downregulation (~30%) of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and upregulation (~60%) of pro-apoptotic Bax proteins were observed. These alterations were restored significantly by diallyl sulfide supplementation, indicating inhibition of apoptosis. Thus, these results show that diallyl sulfide provides protection against oxidative damage induced by 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene in mouse liver and may be an effective chemopreventive and therapeutic agent by modulating expression of cell-growth regulatory proteins.',\n",

Liver samples were taken for pathohistology and transmission electron microscopy. The MCD diet-induced steatosis, inflammation, and balloon-altered hepatocytes were alleviated by betaine. MCD diet induced an increase in mitochondrial size versus the control group (p &lt; 0.01), which was decreased in the betaine-treated group. In the MCD diet-fed group, the total mitochondrial count decreased versus the control group (p &lt; 0.01), while it increased in the MCD + BET group versus MCD (p &lt; 0.01). Electron microscopy showed an increase in the number of autophagosomes in the MCD and MCD + BET group versus control, and a significant difference in autophagosomes number was detected in the MCD + BET group by comparison with the MCD diet-treated group (p &lt; 0.05). Betaine decreases the number of enlarged mitochondria, alleviates steatosis, and increases the number of autophagosomes in the liver of mice with NAFLD.',\n",

However, the underlying mechanisms of NASH development and subsequent fibrosis have yet to be clarified. We compared comprehensive lipidomic profiles between mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and STAM mice with NASH and subsequent fibrosis. The STAM mouse is a model that demonstrates NASH progression resembling the disease in humans: STAM mice manifest NASH at 8 weeks, which progresses to fibrosis at 12 weeks, and finally develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, 250 lipid molecules were detected in the liver using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that STAM mice with NASH presented a significantly higher abundance of sphingolipids and lower levels of triacylglycerols than the HFD-fed control mice. The abundance of certain fatty acids in phospholipid side chains was also significantly different between STAM and control mice, although global levels of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were comparable. Finally, increase in levels of acylcarnitines and some diacylglycerols was observed in STAM mice toward the fibrosis stage, but not in age-matched control mice. Our study provides insights into the lipid status of the steatotic, NASH, and fibrotic liver that would help elucidate the molecular pathophysiology of NASH progression.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Diabetes mellitus (DM) poses a significant global health burden, with hyperglycemia being a primary contributor to complications and high morbidity associated with this disorder. Existing glucose management strategies have shown suboptimal effectiveness, necessitating alternative approaches. In this study, we explored the role of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in hyperglycemia, a protein implicated in initiating inflammation and strongly correlated with DM onset and progression. We hypothesized that HMGB1 knockdown will mitigate hyperglycemia severity and enhance glucose tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a novel inducible HMGB1 knockout (iHMGB1 KO) mouse model exhibiting systemic HMGB1 knockdown. Hyperglycemic phenotype was induced using low dose streptozotocin (STZ) injections, followed by longitudinal glucose measurements and oral glucose tolerance tests to evaluate the effect of HMGB1 knockdown on glucose metabolism. Our findings showed a substantial reduction in glucose levels and enhanced glucose tolerance in HMGB1 knockdown mice. Additionally, we performed RNA sequencing analyses, which identified potential alternations in genes and molecular pathways within the liver and skeletal muscle tissue that may account for the in vivo phenotypic changes observed in hyperglycemic mice following HMGB1 knockdown. In conclusion, our present study delivers the first direct evidence of a causal relationship between systemic HMGB1 knockdown and hyperglycemia in vivo, an association that had remained unexamined prior to this research. This discovery positions HMGB1 knockdown as a potentially efficacious therapeutic target for addressing hyperglycemia and, by extension, the DM epidemic. Furthermore, we have revealed potential underlying mechanisms, establishing the essential groundwork for subsequent in-depth mechanistic investigations focused on further elucidating and harnessing the promising therapeutic potential of HMGB1 in DM management.',\n",

Adiponectin-deficient (adipo(-/-)) mice develop enhanced liver fibrosis, suggesting that adiponectin could be a therapeutic target for liver injury. In the present study, we investigated the protective role of ADP355, an adiponectin-based active short peptide, in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute injury and chronic liver fibrosis in mice. ADP355 remarkably reduced TAA-induced necroinflammation and liver fibrosis. ADP355 treatment increased liver glycogen, decreased serum alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and promoted body weight gain, hyper-proliferation and hypo-apoptosis. In addition, ADP355 administration suppressed the TAA-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells and macrophages in the liver. These were associated with the inactivation of TGF-Î²1/SMAD2 signaling and the promotion of AMPK and STAT3 signaling. Sensitivity of adipo(-/-) mice to chronic liver injury was decreased with ADP355.

These mice had been exposed to constant levels of tritiated water from conception until they were 8 months old. At this point, exposure to tritium was discontinued, and the tritium remaining in DNA and histones was measured at various intervals afterward. The half-lives calculated for these components (with 95% confidence limits given in parentheses) were 117 (85-188) days for liver histone, 318 (241-466) days for liver DNA, 159 (129-208) days for brain histone and 593 (376-1406) days for brain DNA. The difference between histone and DNA turnover is statistically significant for both tissues and indicates that histone turnover within tissues cannot be solely accounted for by cell turnover within the tissue but also must include histone turnover within living cells. The half-life of histone within cells is estimated to be 117 (88-178) days in liver and 223 (187-277) days in brain.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Interferon-gamma may play an important role in the immune response and in inflammatory diseases, including chronic active hepatitis. To understand the role of interferon-gamma in the regulation of inflammation and to establish a mouse model of chronic active hepatitis, we produced transgenic mice in which the mouse interferon-gamma gene was regulated by a liver-specific promoter, the serum amyloid P component gene promoter. Four transgenic mouse lines were generated, and two of these lines expressed mRNA of interferon-gamma in the liver. Levels of serum transaminases increased gradually as a function of age and were significantly higher than those of interferon-gamma-negative littermates after 4 weeks after birth. One transgenic mouse line showed a histology of chronic active hepatitis similar to that found in human patients, although cirrhotic changes such as fibrosis were scarce. Thus, the liver-specific production of interferon-gamma is sufficient to induce chronic inflammatory disease and this mouse is a transgenic model of chronic active hepatitis.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'Cholesterol is an essential lipid and its synthesis is nutritionally and energetically costly<SUP>1,2</SUP>. In mammals, cholesterol biosynthesis increases after feeding and is inhibited under fasting conditions<SUP>3</SUP>. However, the regulatory mechanisms of cholesterol biosynthesis at the fasting-feeding transition remain poorly understood. Here we show that the deubiquitylase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20) stabilizes HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in the feeding state. The post-prandial increase in insulin and glucose concentration stimulates mTORC1 to phosphorylate USP20 at S132 and S134; USP20 is recruited to the HMGCR complex and antagonizes its degradation. The feeding-induced stabilization of HMGCR is abolished in mice with liver-specific Usp20 deletion and in USP20(S132A/S134A) knock-in mice. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of USP20 markedly decreases diet-induced body weight gain, reduces lipid levels in the serum and liver, improves insulin sensitivity and increases energy expenditure. These metabolic changes are reversed by expression of the constitutively stable HMGCR(K248R). This study reveals an unexpected regulatory axis from mTORC1 to HMGCR via USP20 phosphorylation and suggests that inhibitors of USP20 could be used to lower cholesterol levels to treat metabolic diseases including hyperlipidaemia, liver steatosis, obesity and diabetes.',\n",

       "    'abstract': 'The liver is rich in mitochondria and has an exceptional regenerative capacity after partial hepatectomy or transplantation, viral infections, or chemical injuries; however, relatively little is known about the genetic factors for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication during liver regeneration. Here, we show that liver regeneration is markedly reduced in mice lacking mitochondrial topoisomerase I (TOP1mt). This defect is linked with reduced production of mtDNA and defective mitochondrial functions during acute energy demand for liver regeneration. Additionally, TOP1mt KO primary hepatocytes from CCl<SUB>4</SUB>-treated mice showed reduced and damaged mitochondria, decreased O<SUB>2</SUB> consumption, and ATP production. Together with mtDNA depletion and regeneration experiments with ethidium bromide, these results demonstrate that Top1mt is required for mtDNA synthesis and appropriate liver regeneration.',\n",
