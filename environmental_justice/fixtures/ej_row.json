The maps were derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) imagery and two separate multiple linear regression models trained with field data; one for the Plains and a second for the Shield ecoregion. Field observations were used to estimate area burned in each of five severity classes (unburned, singed, light, moderate, severely burned) in six stratified randomly selected plots of 10 x 10-m in size across a 1-ha site. Using this five class scale a burn severity index (BSI) for each 1-ha site was calculated using multiple weighted and averaged field parameters. Pre- and post-fire phenologically paired Landsat 8 images were used to model the five discrete severity classes using midpoints as breaks.",

Because of the lack of globally consistent data on migration, indirect estimation methods were used. The authors relied on a combination of data on spatial population distribution for four time slices (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and subnational rates of natural increase in order to derive estimates of net migration on a 30 arc-second (~1km) grid cell basis. Net migration was estimated by subtracting the population in time period 2 from the population in time period 1, and then subtracting the natural increase (births minus deaths). The residual was considered to be net migration (in-migrants minus out-migrants). The authors ran 13 geospatial net migration estimation models based on outputs from the same number of imputation runs for urban and rural rates of natural increase.This data set represents the average of those runs. These data are reliable at broad scales of analysis (e.g. ecosystems or regions), but are generally not reliable for local level analyses.

These layers are co-registered to the same spatial extent at a common 30m spatial resolution. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands. This dataset is one of the first global, 30m datasets of man-made impervious cover to be derived from the GLS data for 2010 and is a companion dataset to the Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) dataset. The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.",

Each of the category risk surfaces are constructed by adding all the relevant hazard high-risk surfaces. These categorical risk surfaces are reclassified into binary high-risk surfaces. The combination of the category risk values forms a three digit identifier for determining those locations that are at higher-risk from multihazards.

First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards.

Spatial urban land projections are key inputs for the analysis of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as for the assessment of climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation. This data set presents a set of global, spatially explicit urban land scenarios that are consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to produce an empirically-grounded set of urban land spatial distributions over the 21st century. A data-science approach is used exploiting 15 diverse data sets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations from the Landsat satellite series. The SSPs are developed to support future climate and global change research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), along with Special Reports.",

All country road networks have been joined topologically at the borders, and many countries have been edited for internal topology. Source data for each country are provided in the documentation, and users are encouraged to refer to the readme file for use constraints that apply to a small number of countries. Because the data are compiled from multiple sources, the date range for road network representations ranges from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country (most countries have no confirmed date), and spatial accuracy varies. The baseline global data set was compiled by the Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS) of the University of Georgia. Updated data for 27 countries and 6 smaller geographic entities were assembled by Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), with a focus largely on developing countries with the poorest data coverage.",

            "description": "The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect represents the relatively higher temperatures found in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas owing to higher proportions of impervious surfaces and the release of waste heat from vehicles and heating and cooling systems. Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release long-wave radiation after a lag of a few hours. The Global Urban Heat Island (UHI) Data Set, 2013, estimates the land surface temperature within urban areas in degrees Celsius (average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum) as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas, defined as a 10km buffer around the urban extent. Urban extents are from SEDAC?s Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1), and land surface temperatures are from SEDAC?s Global Summer Land Surface Temperature (LST) Grids, 2013, which are derived from the Aqua Level-3 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Version 5 global daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) 8-day composite data (MYD11A2). For most regions, the UHI data set provides the average daytime maximum (1:30 p.m. overpass) and average nighttime minimum (1:30 a.m. overpass) temperatures in urban and rural areas, and the urban-rural temperature differences, derived from LST data representing a 40-day time-span during July-August (Julian days 185-224) in the northern hemisphere and January-February (Julian days 001-040) in the southern hemisphere. LST grid cells with missing values resulting from high cloud cover in tropical regions were filled with daytime maximum and nighttime minimum LST values from April-May 2013 in the northern hemisphere and December 2013-January 2014 in the southern hemisphere, where available. Some data gaps remain in areas where data were insufficient (e.g., Central Africa).",

This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population by drawing on a newer collection of input data, and provides a range of estimates for at-risk population and land area. Constructing accurate estimates requires high-quality and methodologically consistent input data, and the LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals, digital elevation model, and spatially-delimited urban classifications. Users can find the paper \"Estimating Population and Urban Areas at Risk of Coastal Hazards, 1990-2015: How data choices matter\" (MacManus, et al. 2021) in order to evaluate selected inputs for modeling Low Elevation Coastal Zones. According to the paper, the following are considered core data sets for the purposes of LECZv3 estimates: Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM), Global Human Settlement (GHSL) Population Grid R2019 and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid R2019a v2, and the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11.

This data set combines AOD retrievals from multiple satellite algorithms including the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Collection 6.1 (MODIS C6.1), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer Version 23 (MISRv23), MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Collection 6 (MAIAC C6), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) Deep Blue Version 4. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model is used to relate this total column measure of aerosol to near-surface PM2.5 concentration. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used with global ground-based measurements from the World Health Organization (WHO) database to predict and adjust for the residual PM2.5 bias per grid cell in the initial satellite-derived values. These estimates are primarily intended to aid in large-scale studies. Gridded data sets are provided at a resolution of 0.01 degrees to allow users to agglomerate data as best meets their particular needs. Data sets are gridded at the finest resolution of the information sources that were incorporated, but do not fully resolve PM2.5 gradients at the gridded resolution due to influence by information sources at coarser resolution.

SVI values range between 0 and 1 based on their percentile position among all census tracts in the U.S., with 0 representing lowest vulnerability census tracts and 1 representing highest vulnerability census tracts. SEDAC has gridded these vector inputs to create 1 km spatial resolution raster surfaces allowing users to obtain vulnerability metrics for any user-defined area within the U.S. Utilizing inputs from CIESIN's Gridded Population of the World, Version 4, Revision 11 (GPWv4.11), a mask is applied for water, and optionally, for no population. The data are provided in two different projection formats, NAD83 as a U.S. specific standard, and WGS84 as a global standard.
